In the beginning God created the heaven and the earthAnd the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the watersAnd God said Let there be light and there was lightAnd God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darknessAnd God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night And the evening and the morning were the first dayAnd God said Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the watersAnd God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was soAnd God called the firmament Heaven And the evening and the morning were the second dayAnd God said Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was soAnd God called the dry land Earth and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas and God saw that it was goodAnd God said Let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was soAnd the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was goodAnd the evening and the morning were the third dayAnd God said Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and yearsAnd let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was soAnd God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars alsoAnd God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earthAnd to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was goodAnd the evening and the morning were the fourth dayAnd God said Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heavenAnd God created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and God saw that it was goodAnd God blessed them saying Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earthAnd the evening and the morning were the fifth dayAnd God said Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was soAnd God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and God saw that it was goodAnd God said Let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earthSo God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he themAnd God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earthAnd God said Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meatAnd to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was soAnd God saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good And the evening and the morning were the sixth dayThus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of themAnd on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had madeAnd God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and madeThese are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavensAnd every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the groundBut there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the groundAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soulAnd the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formedAnd out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evilAnd a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four headsThe name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah where there is goldAnd the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stoneAnd the name of the second river is Gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of EthiopiaAnd the name of the third river is Hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria And the fourth river is EuphratesAnd the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep itAnd the LORD God commanded the man saying Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eatBut of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dieAnd the LORD God said It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for himAnd out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereofAnd Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meet for himAnd the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereofAnd the rib which the LORD God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the manAnd Adam said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of ManTherefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one fleshAnd they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamedNow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made And he said unto the woman Yea hath God said Ye shall not eat of every tree of the gardenAnd the woman said unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the gardenBut of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye dieAnd the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely dieFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evilAnd when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eatAnd the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apronsAnd they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the gardenAnd the LORD God called unto Adam and said unto him Where art thouAnd he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myselfAnd he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eatAnd the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eatAnd the LORD God said unto the woman What is this that thou hast done And the woman said The serpent beguiled me and I did eatAnd the LORD God said unto the serpent Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy lifeAnd I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heelUnto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over theeAnd unto Adam he said Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy lifeThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the fieldIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou returnAnd Adam called his wifes name Eve because she was the mother of all livingUnto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins and clothed themAnd the LORD God said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for everTherefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was takenSo he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of lifeAnd Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the LORDAnd she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the groundAnd in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORDAnd Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offeringBut unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fellAnd the LORD said unto Cain Why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallenIf thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door And unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over himAnd Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew himAnd the LORD said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother And he said I know not Am I my brothers keeperAnd he said What hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the groundAnd now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy handWhen thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earthAnd Cain said unto the LORD My punishment is greater than I can bearBehold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay meAnd the LORD said unto him Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold And the LORD set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill himAnd Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of EdenAnd Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son EnochAnd unto Enoch was born Irad and Irad begat Mehujael and Mehujael begat Methusael and Methusael begat LamechAnd Lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other ZillahAnd Adah bare Jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattleAnd his brothers name was Jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organAnd Zillah she also bare Tubal-cain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of Tubal-cain was NaamahAnd Lamech said unto his wives Adah and Zillah Hear my voice ye wives of Lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurtIf Cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly Lamech seventy and sevenfoldAnd Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth For God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slewAnd to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the LORDThis is the book of the generations of Adam In the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he himMale and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were createdAnd Adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name SethAnd the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he diedAnd Seth lived an hundred and five years and begat EnosAnd Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he diedAnd Enos lived ninety years and begat CainanAnd Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years and he diedAnd Cainan lived seventy years and begat MahalaleelAnd Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he diedAnd Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat JaredAnd Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he diedAnd Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat EnochAnd Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he diedAnd Enoch lived sixty and five years and begat MethuselahAnd Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five yearsAnd Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took himAnd Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat LamechAnd Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he diedAnd Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a sonAnd he called his name Noah saying This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the LORD hath cursedAnd Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he diedAnd Noah was five hundred years old and Noah begat Shem Ham and JaphethAnd it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto themThat the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they choseAnd the LORD said My spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty yearsThere were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renownAnd GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continuallyAnd it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heartAnd the LORD said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made themBut Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORDThese are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with GodAnd Noah begat three sons Shem Ham and JaphethThe earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violenceAnd God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earthAnd God said unto Noah The end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earthMake thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitchAnd this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubitsA window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make itAnd behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall dieBut with thee will I establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with theeAnd of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and femaleOf fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them aliveAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for themThus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so did heAnd the LORD said unto Noah Come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generationOf every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his femaleOf fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earthFor yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earthAnd Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded himAnd Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earthAnd Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the floodOf clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earthThere went in two and two unto Noah into the ark the male and the female as God had commanded NoahAnd it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earthIn the six hundredth year of Noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were openedAnd the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nightsIn the selfsame day entered Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and Noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the arkThey and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sortAnd they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of lifeAnd they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as God had commanded him and the LORD shut him inAnd the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earthAnd the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the watersAnd the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were coveredFifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were coveredAnd all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every manAll in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land diedAnd every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the arkAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty daysAnd God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswagedThe fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrainedAnd the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abatedAnd the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of AraratAnd the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seenAnd it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had madeAnd he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earthAlso he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the groundBut the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the arkAnd he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the arkAnd the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earthAnd he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any moreAnd it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dryAnd in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth driedAnd God spake unto Noah sayingGo forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with theeBring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earthAnd Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with himEvery beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the arkAnd Noah builded an altar unto the LORD and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altarAnd the LORD smelled a sweet savour and the LORD said in his heart I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will I again smite any more every thing living as I have doneWhile the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not ceaseAnd God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earthAnd the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they deliveredEvery moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have I given you all thingsBut flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eatAnd surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast will I require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of manWhoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he manAnd you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply thereinAnd God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him sayingAnd I behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after youAnd with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earthAnd I will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earthAnd God said This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generationsI do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earthAnd it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloudAnd I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all fleshAnd the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earthAnd God said unto Noah This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earthAnd the sons of Noah that went forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth and Ham is the father of CanaanThese are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth overspreadAnd Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyardAnd he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tentAnd Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren withoutAnd Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakednessAnd Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto himAnd he said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethrenAnd he said Blessed be the LORD God of Shem and Canaan shall be his servantGod shall enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be his servantAnd Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty yearsAnd all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he diedNow these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth and unto them were sons born after the floodThe sons of Japheth Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and TirasAnd the sons of Gomer Ashkenaz and Riphath and TogarmahAnd the sons of Javan Elishah and Tarshish Kittim and DodanimBy these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nationsAnd the sons of Ham Cush and Mizraim and Phut and CanaanAnd the sons of Cush Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtecha and the sons of Raamah Sheba and DedanAnd Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earthHe was a mighty hunter before the LORD wherefore it is said Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORDAnd the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of ShinarOut of that land went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh and the city Rehoboth and CalahAnd Resen between Nineveh and Calah the same is a great cityAnd Mizraim begat Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and NaphtuhimAnd Pathrusim and Casluhim out of whom came Philistim and CaphtorimAnd Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn and HethAnd the Jebusite and the Amorite and the GirgasiteAnd the Hivite and the Arkite and the SiniteAnd the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroadAnd the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar unto Gaza as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboim even unto LashaThese are the sons of Ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nationsUnto Shem also the father of all the children of Eber the brother of Japheth the elder even to him were children bornThe children of Shem Elam and Asshur and Arphaxad and Lud and AramAnd the children of Aram Uz and Hul and Gether and MashAnd Arphaxad begat Salah and Salah begat EberAnd unto Eber were born two sons the name of one was Peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was JoktanAnd Joktan begat Almodad and Sheleph and Hazar-maveth and JerahAnd Hadoram and Uzal and DiklahAnd Obal and Abimael and ShebaAnd Ophir and Havilah and Jobab all these were the sons of JoktanAnd their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the eastThese are the sons of Shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nationsThese are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the floodAnd the whole earth was of one language and of one speechAnd it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt thereAnd they said one to another Go to let us make brick and burn them throughly And they had brick for stone and slime had they for morterAnd they said Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earthAnd the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men buildedAnd the LORD said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to doGo to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speechSo the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the cityTherefore is the name of it called Babel because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earthThese are the generations of Shem Shem was an hundred years old and begat Arphaxad two years after the floodAnd Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughtersAnd Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat SalahAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred

lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughtersAnd Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram Nahor and HaranNow these are the generations of Terah Terah begat Abram Nahor and Haran and Haran begat LotAnd Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity in Ur of the ChaldeesAnd Abram and Nahor took them wives the name of Abrams wife was Sarai and the name of Nahors wife Milcah the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of IscahBut Sarai was barren she had no childAnd Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran his sons son and Sarai his daughter in law his son Abrams wife and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Haran and dwelt thereAnd the days of Terah were two hundred and five years and Terah died in HaranNow the LORD had said unto Abram Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that I will shew theeAnd I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessingAnd I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessedSo Abram departed as the LORD had spoken unto him and Lot went with him and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of HaranAnd Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Haran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they cameAnd Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem unto the plain of Moreh And the Canaanite was then in the landAnd the LORD appeared unto Abram and said Unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded he an altar unto the LORD who appeared unto himAnd he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the LORD and called upon the name of the LORDAnd Abram journeyed going on still toward the southAnd there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the landAnd it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarai his wife Behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look uponTherefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say This is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee aliveSay I pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of theeAnd it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fairThe princes also of Pharaoh saw her and commended her before Pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaohs houseAnd he entreated Abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camelsAnd the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abrams wifeAnd Pharaoh called Abram and said What is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wifeWhy saidst thou She is my sister so I might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy wayAnd Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he hadAnd Abram went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him into the southAnd Abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in goldAnd he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and HaiUnto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the name of the LORDAnd Lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tentsAnd the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell togetherAnd there was a strife between the herdmen of Abrams cattle and the herdmen of Lots cattle and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the landAnd Abram said unto Lot Let there be no strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethrenIs not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the leftAnd Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered every where before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the LORD like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto ZoarThen Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the otherAbram dwelled in the land of Canaan and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward SodomBut the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedinglyAnd the LORD said unto Abram after that Lot was separated from him Lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westwardFor all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed for everAnd I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numberedArise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto theeThen Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the LORDAnd it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar Arioch king of Ellasar Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of nationsThat these made war with Bera king of Sodom and with Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah and Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela which is ZoarAll these were joined together in the vale of Siddim which is the salt seaTwelve years they served Chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelledAnd in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim and the Zuzims in Ham and the Emims in Shaveh KiriathaimAnd the Horites in their mount Seir unto El-paran which is by the wildernessAnd they returned and came to En-mishpat which is Kadesh and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamarAnd there went out the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela the same is Zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of SiddimWith Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and with Tidal king of nations and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar four kings with fiveAnd the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountainAnd they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals and went their wayAnd they took Lot Abrams brothers son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departedAnd there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite brother of Eschol and brother of Aner and these were confederate with AbramAnd when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto DanAnd he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah which is on the left hand of DamascusAnd he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the peopleAnd the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shaveh which is the kings daleAnd Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high GodAnd he blessed him and said Blessed be Abram of the most high God possessor of heaven and earthAnd blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand And he gave him tithes of allAnd the king of Sodom said unto Abram Give me the persons and take the goods to thyselfAnd Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD the most high God the possessor of heaven and earthThat I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that I will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say I have made Abram richSave only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me Aner Eshcol and Mamre let them take their portionAfter these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision saying Fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great rewardAnd Abram said Lord GOD what wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of DamascusAnd Abram said Behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heirAnd behold the word of the LORD came unto him saying This shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heirAnd he brought him forth abroad and said Look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him So shall thy seed beAnd he believed in the LORD and he counted it to him for righteousnessAnd he said unto him I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit itAnd he said Lord GOD whereby shall I know that I shall inherit itAnd he said unto him Take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeonAnd he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he notAnd when the fowls came down upon the carcases Abram drove them awayAnd when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon himAnd he said unto Abram Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred yearsAnd also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substanceAnd thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old ageBut in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet fullAnd it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those piecesIn the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram saying Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river the river EuphratesThe Kenites and the Kenizzites and the KadmonitesAnd the Hittites and the Perizzites and the RephaimsAnd the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the JebusitesNow Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an Egyptian whose name was HagarAnd Sarai said unto Abram Behold now the LORD hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her And Abram hearkened to the voice of SaraiAnd Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wifeAnd he went in unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyesAnd Sarai said unto Abram My wrong be upon thee I have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes the LORD judge between me and theeBut Abram said unto Sarai Behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee And when Sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her faceAnd the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to ShurAnd he said Hagar Sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go And she said I flee from the face of my mistress SaraiAnd the angel of the LORD said unto her Return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her handsAnd the angel of the LORD said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitudeAnd the angel of the LORD said unto her Behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael because the LORD hath heard thy afflictionAnd he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethrenAnd she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her Thou God seest me for she said Have I also here looked after him that seeth meWherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi behold it is between Kadesh and BeredAnd Hagar bare Abram a son and Abram called his sons name which Hagar bare IshmaelAnd Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bare Ishmael to AbramAnd when Abram was ninety years old and nine the LORD appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfectAnd I will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedinglyAnd Abram fell on his face and God talked with him sayingAs for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nationsNeither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made theeAnd I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of theeAnd I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after theeAnd I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their GodAnd God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generationsThis is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee Every man child among you shall be circumcisedAnd ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and youAnd he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seedHe that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenantAnd the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenantAnd God said unto Abraham As for Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall her name beAnd I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of herThen Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall Sarah that is ninety years old bearAnd Abraham said unto God O that Ishmael might live before theeAnd God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after himAnd as for Ishmael I have heard thee Behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nationBut my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next yearAnd he left off talking with him and God went up from AbrahamAnd Abraham took Ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of Abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as God had said unto himAnd Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskinAnd Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskinIn the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised and Ishmael his sonAnd all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with himAnd the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the dayAnd he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the groundAnd said My Lord if now I have found favour in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servantLet a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the treeAnd I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant And they said So do as thou hast saidAnd Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearthAnd Abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress itAnd he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eatAnd they said unto him Where is Sarah thy wife And he said Behold in the tentAnd he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind himNow Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of womenTherefore Sarah laughed within herself saying After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old alsoAnd the LORD said unto Abraham Wherefore did Sarah laugh saying Shall I of a surety bear a child which am oldIs any thing too hard for the LORD At the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a sonThen Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid And he said Nay but thou didst laughAnd the men rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the wayAnd the LORD said Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doSeeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in himFor I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the LORD to do justice and judgment that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of himAnd the LORD said Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievousI will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will knowAnd the men turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the LORDAnd Abraham drew near and said Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wickedPeradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are thereinThat be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee Shall not the Judge of all the earth do rightAnd the LORD said If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakesAnd Abraham answered and said Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but dust and ashesPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five And he said If I find there forty and five I will not destroy itAnd he spake unto him yet again and said Peradventure there shall be forty found there And he said I will not do it for fortys sakeAnd he said unto him Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak Peradventure there shall thirty be found there And he said I will not do it if I find thirty thereAnd he said Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord Peradventure there shall be twenty found there And he said I will not destroy it for twentys sakeAnd he said Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once Peradventure ten shall be found there And he said I will not destroy it for tens sakeAnd the LORD went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his placeAnd there came two angels to Sodom at even and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the groundAnd he said Behold now my lords turn in I pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways And they said Nay but we will abide in the street all nightAnd he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eatBut before they lay down the men of the city even the men of Sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarterAnd they called unto Lot and said unto him Where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know themAnd Lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after himAnd said I pray you brethren do not so wickedlyBehold now I have two daughters which have not known man let me I pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roofAnd they said Stand back And they said again This one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them And they pressed sore upon the man even Lot and came near to break the doorBut the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house to them and shut to the doorAnd they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the doorAnd the men said unto Lot Hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this placeFor we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD and the LORD hath sent us to destroy itAnd Lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said Up get you out of this place for the LORD will destroy this city But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in lawAnd when the morning arose then the angels hastened Lot saying Arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the cityAnd while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the LORD being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the cityAnd it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumedAnd Lot said unto them Oh not so my LordBehold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I dieBehold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one Oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall liveAnd he said unto him See I have accepted thee concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spokenHaste thee escape thither for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither Therefore the name of the city was called ZoarThe sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into ZoarThen the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heavenAnd he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the groundBut his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of saltAnd Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORDAnd he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnaceAnd it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dweltAnd Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in Zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughtersAnd the firstborn said unto the younger Our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earthCome let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our fatherAnd they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she aroseAnd it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger Behold I lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our FatherAnd they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she aroseThus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their fatherAnd the firstborn bare a son and called his name Moab the same is the father of the Moabites unto this dayAnd the younger she also bare a son and called his name Benammi the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this dayAnd Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in GerarAnd Abraham said of Sarah his wife She is my sister and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took SarahBut God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him Behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a mans wifeBut Abimelech had not come near her and he said Lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nationSaid he not unto me She is my sister and she even she herself said He is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done thisAnd God said unto him in a dream Yea I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for I also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered I thee not to touch herNow therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thineTherefore Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraidThen Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him What hast thou done unto us and what have I offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be doneAnd Abimelech said unto Abraham What sawest thou that thou hast done this thingAnd Abraham said Because I thought Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sakeAnd yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wifeAnd it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my fathers house that I said unto her This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me He is my brotherAnd Abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wifeAnd Abimelech said Behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth theeAnd unto Sarah he said Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reprovedSo Abraham prayed unto God and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare childrenFor the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah Abrahams wifeAnd the LORD visited Sarah as he had said and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spokenFor Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to himAnd Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bare to him IsaacAnd Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as God had commanded himAnd Abraham was an hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto himAnd Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with meAnd she said Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck for I have born him a son in his old ageAnd the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weanedAnd Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had born unto Abraham mockingWherefore she said unto Abraham Cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with IsaacAnd the thing was very grievous in Abrahams sight because of his sonAnd God said unto Abraham Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be calledAnd also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seedAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-shebaAnd the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubsAnd she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bowshot for she said Let me not see the death of the child And she sat over against him and lift up her voice and weptAnd God heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven and said unto her What aileth thee Hagar fear not for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he isArise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for I will make him a great nationAnd God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drinkAnd God was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archerAnd he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of EgyptAnd it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham saying God is with thee in all that thou doestNow therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojournedAnd Abraham said I will swearAnd Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelechs servants had violently taken awayAnd Abimelech said I wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard I of it but to dayAnd Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech and both of them made a covenantAnd Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselvesAnd Abimelech said unto Abraham What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselvesAnd he said For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that I have digged this wellWherefore he called that place Beer-sheba because there they sware both of themThus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba then Abimelech rose up and Phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the PhilistinesAnd Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba and called there on the name of the LORD the everlasting GodAnd Abraham sojourned in the Philistines land many daysAnd it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said Behold here I amAnd he said Take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee ofAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told himThen on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar offAnd Abraham said unto his young men Abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to youAnd Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them togetherAnd Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father and he said Here am I my son And he said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offeringAnd Abraham said My son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them togetherAnd they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the woodAnd Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his sonAnd the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said Here am IAnd he said Lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from meAnd Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his sonAnd Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh as it is said to this day In the mount of the LORD it shall be seenAnd the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second timeAnd said By myself have I sworn saith the LORD for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only sonThat in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemiesAnd in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voiceSo Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba and Abraham dwelt at Beer-shebaAnd it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham saying Behold Milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother NahorHuz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of AramAnd Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and BethuelAnd Bethuel begat Rebekah these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor Abrahams brotherAnd his concubine whose name was Reumah she bare also Tebah and Gaham and Thahash and MaachahAnd Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of SarahAnd Sarah died in Kirjath-arba the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for herAnd Abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of Heth sayingI am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that I may bury my dead out of my sightAnd the children of Heth answered Abraham saying unto himHear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy deadAnd Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of HethAnd he communed with them saying If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to Ephron the son of ZoharThat he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst youAnd Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city sayingNay my lord hear me the field give I thee and the cave that is therein I give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee bury thy deadAnd Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the landAnd he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying But if thou wilt give it I pray thee hear me I will give thee money for the field take it of me and I will bury my dead thereAnd Ephron answered Abraham saying unto himMy lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy deadAnd Abraham hearkened unto Ephron and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchantAnd the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah which was before Mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sureUnto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth before all that went in at the gate of his cityAnd after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre the same is Hebron in the land of CanaanAnd the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of HethAnd Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all thingsAnd Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had Put I pray thee thy hand under my thighAnd I will make thee swear by the LORD the God of heaven and the God of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwellBut thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son IsaacAnd the servant said unto him Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camestAnd Abraham said unto him Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither againThe LORD God of heaven which took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying Unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thenceAnd if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither againAnd the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matterAnd the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of NahorAnd he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw waterAnd he said O LORD God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master AbrahamBehold I stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw waterAnd let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say Let down thy pitcher I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say Drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my masterAnd it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebekah came out who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulderAnd the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came upAnd the servant ran to meet her and said Let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcherAnd she said Drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drinkAnd when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinkingAnd she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camelsAnd the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or notAnd it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of goldAnd said Whose daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge inAnd she said unto him I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah which she bare unto NahorShe said moreover unto him We have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge inAnd the man bowed down his head and worshipped the LORDAnd he said Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being in the way the LORD led me to the house of my masters brethrenAnd the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these thingsAnd Rebekah had a brother and his name was Laban and Laban ran out unto the man unto the wellAnd it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying Thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the wellAnd he said Come in thou blessed of the LORD wherefore standest thou without for I have prepared the house and room for the camelsAnd the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that were with himAnd there was set meat before him to eat but he said I will not eat until I have told mine errand And he said Speak onAnd he said I am Abrahams servantAnd the LORD hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and assesAnd Sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hathAnd my master made me swear saying Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwellBut thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my sonAnd I said unto my master Peradventure the woman will not follow meAnd he said unto me The LORD before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers houseThen shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oathAnd I came this day unto the well and said O LORD God of my master Abraham if now thou do prosper my way which I goBehold I stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and I say to her Give me I pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drinkAnd she say to me Both drink thou and I will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my masters sonAnd before I had done speaking in mine heart behold Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and I said unto her Let me drink I pray theeAnd she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said Drink and I will give thy camels drink also so I drank and she made the camels drink alsoAnd I asked her and said Whose daughter art thou And she said The daughter of Bethuel Nahors son whom Milcah bare unto him and I put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her handsAnd I bowed down my head and worshipped the LORD and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his sonAnd now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the leftThen Laban and Bethuel answered and said The thing proceedeth from the LORD we cannot speak unto thee bad or goodBehold Rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the LORD hath spokenAnd it came to pass that when Abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the LORD bowing himself to the earthAnd the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to Rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious thingsAnd they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said Send me away unto my masterAnd her brother and her mother said Let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall goAnd he said unto them Hinder me not seeing the LORD hath prospered my way send me away that I may go to my masterAnd they said We will call the damsel and inquire at her mouthAnd they called Rebekah and said unto her Wilt thou go with this man And she said I will goAnd they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse and Abrahams servant and his menAnd they blessed Rebekah and said unto her Thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate themAnd Rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebekah and went his wayAnd Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi for he dwelt in the south countryAnd Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were comingAnd Rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camelFor she had said unto the servant What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us And the servant had said It is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herselfAnd the servant told Isaac all things that he had doneAnd Isaac brought her into his mother Sarahs tent and took Rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mothers deathThen again Abraham took a wife and her name was KeturahAnd she bare him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and ShuahAnd Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and LeummimAnd the sons of Midian Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah All these were the children of KeturahAnd Abraham gave all that he had unto IsaacBut unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east countryAnd these are the days of the years of Abrahams life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen yearsThen Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his peopleAnd his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite which is before MamreThe field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth there was Abraham buried and Sarah his wifeAnd it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roiNow these are the generations of Ishmael Abrahams son whom Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs handmaid bare unto AbrahamAnd these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of Ishmael Nebajoth and Kedar and Adbeel and MibsamAnd Mishma and Dumah and MassaHadar and Tema Jetur Naphish and KedemahThese are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nationsAnd these are the years of the life of Ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his peopleAnd they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt as thou goest toward Assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethrenAnd these are the generations of Isaac Abrahams son Abraham begat IsaacAnd Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram the sister to Laban the SyrianAnd Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife because she was barren and the LORD was intreated of him and Rebekah his wife conceivedAnd the children struggled together within her and she said If it be so why am I thus And she went to inquire of the LORDAnd the LORD said unto her Two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the youngerAnd when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her wombAnd the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name EsauAnd after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esaus heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare themAnd the boys grew and Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tentsAnd Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebekah loved JacobAnd Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faintAnd Esau said to Jacob Feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called EdomAnd Jacob said Sell me this day thy birthrightAnd Esau said Behold I am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to meAnd Jacob said Swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto JacobThen Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his birthrightAnd there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto GerarAnd the LORD appeared unto him and said Go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee ofSojourn in this land and I will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy fatherAnd I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessedBecause that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my lawsAnd Isaac dwelt in GerarAnd the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said She is my sister for he feared to say She is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah because she was fair to look uponAnd it came to pass when he had been there a long time that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wifeAnd Abimelech called Isaac and said Behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou She is my sister And Isaac said unto him Because I said Lest I die for herAnd Abimelech said What is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon usAnd Abimelech charged all his people saying He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to deathThen Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the LORD blessed himAnd the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very greatFor he had possession of flocks and possessions of herds and great store of servants and the Philistines envied himFor all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earthAnd Abimelech said unto Isaac Go from us for thou art much mightier than weAnd Isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar and dwelt thereAnd Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called themAnd Isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing waterAnd the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaacs herdmen saying The water is ours and he called the name of the well Esek because they strove with himAnd they digged another well and strove for that alsoand he called the name of it SitnahAnd he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it Rehoboth and he said For now the LORD hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the landAnd he went up from thence to Beer-shebaAnd the LORD appeared unto him the same night and said I am the God of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abrahams sakeAnd he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there and there Isaacs servants digged a wellThen Abimelech went to him from Gerar and Ahuzzath one of his friends and Phichol the chief captain of his armyAnd Isaac said unto them Wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from youAnd they said We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee and we said Let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with theeThat thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the LORDAnd he made them a feast and they did eat and drinkAnd they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peaceAnd it came to pass the same day that Isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him We have found waterAnd he called it Shebah therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this dayAnd Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the HittiteWhich were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to RebekahAnd it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said unto him My son and he said unto him Behold here am IAnd he said Behold now I am old I know not the day of my deathNow therefore take I pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venisonAnd make me savoury meat such as I love and bring it to me that I may eat that my soul may bless thee before I dieAnd Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring itAnd Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son saying Behold I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother sayingBring me venison and make me savoury meat that I may eat and bless thee before the LORD before my deathNow therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I command theeGo now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and I will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he lovethAnd thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his deathAnd Jacob said to Rebekah his mother Behold Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth manMy father peradventure will feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessingAnd his mother said unto him Upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me themAnd he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father lovedAnd Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau which were with her in the house and put them upon Jacob her younger sonAnd she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neckAnd she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son JacobAnd he came unto his father and said My father and he said Here am I who art thou my sonAnd Jacob said unto his father I am Esau thy firstborn I have done according as thou badest me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless meAnd Isaac said unto his son How is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son And he said Because the LORD thy God brought it to meAnd Isaac said unto Jacob Come near I pray thee that I may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son Esau or notAnd Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felt him and said The voice is Jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of EsauAnd he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother Esaus hands so he blessed himAnd he said Art thou my very son Esau And he said I amAnd he said Bring it near to me and I will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee And he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drankAnd his father Isaac said unto him Come near now and kiss me my sonAnd he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said See the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessedTherefore God give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wineLet people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth theeAnd it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father that Esau his brother came in from his huntingAnd he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father Let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless meAnd Isaac his father said unto him Who art thou And he said I am thy son thy firstborn EsauAnd Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said Who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and I have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessedAnd when Esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father Bless me even me also O my fatherAnd he said Thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessingAnd he said Is not he rightly named Jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing And he said Hast thou not reserved a blessing for meAnd Isaac answered and said unto Esau Behold I have made him thy lord and all his brethren have I given to him for servants and with corn and wine have I sustained him and what shall I do now unto thee my sonAnd Esau said unto his father Hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also O my father And Esau lifted up his voice and weptAnd Isaac his father answered and said unto him Behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from aboveAnd by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neckAnd Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and Esau said in his heart The days of mourning for my father are at hand then will I slay my brother JacobAnd these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah and she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said unto him Behold thy brother Esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill theeNow therefore my son obey my voice and arise flee thou to Laban my brother to HaranAnd tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn awayUntil thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then I will send and fetch thee from thence why should I be deprived also of you both in one dayAnd Rebekah said to Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do meAnd Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of CanaanArise go to Padan-aram to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brotherAnd God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of peopleAnd give thee the blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which God gave unto AbrahamAnd Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban son of Bethuel the Syrian the brother of Rebekah Jacobs and Esaus motherWhen Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan-aram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of CanaanAnd that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to Padan-aramAnd Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his fatherThen went Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams son the sister of Nebajoth to be his wifeAnd Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward HaranAnd he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleepAnd he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on itAnd behold the LORD stood above it and said I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seedAnd thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessedAnd behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee ofAnd Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said Surely the LORD is in this place and I knew it notAnd he was afraid and said How dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heavenAnd Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of itAnd he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of that city was called Luz at the firstAnd Jacob vowed a vow saying If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put onSo that I come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the LORD be my GodAnd this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be Gods house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto theeThen Jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the eastAnd he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouthAnd thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his placeAnd Jacob said unto them My brethren whence be ye And they said Of Haran are weAnd he said unto them Know ye Laban the son of Nahor And they said We know himAnd he said unto them Is he well And they said He is well and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheepAnd he said Lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed themAnd they said We cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheepAnd while he yet spake with them Rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept themAnd it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mothers brotherAnd Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and weptAnd Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was Rebekahs son and she ran and told her fatherAnd it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house And he told Laban all these thingsAnd Laban said to him Surely thou art my bone and my flesh And he abode with him the space of a monthAnd Laban said unto Jacob Because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages beAnd Laban had two daughters the name of the elder was Leah and the name of the younger was RachelLeah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favouredAnd Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughterAnd Laban said It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man abide with meAnd Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to herAnd Jacob said unto Laban Give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto herAnd Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feastAnd it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto herAnd Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaidAnd it came to pass that in the morning behold it was Leah and he said to Laban What is this thou hast done unto me did not I serve with thee for Rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled meAnd Laban said It must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstbornFulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other yearsAnd Jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife alsoAnd Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maidAnd he went in also unto Rachel and he loved also Rachel more than Leah and served with him yet seven other yearsAnd when the LORD saw that Leah was hated he opened her womb but Rachel was barrenAnd Leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name Reuben for she said Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love meAnd she conceived again and bare a son and said Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name SimeonAnd she conceived again and bare a son and said Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have born him three sons therefore was his name called LeviAnd she conceived again and bare a son and she said Now will I praise the LORD therefore she called his name Judah and left bearingAnd when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob Give me children or else I dieAnd Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel and he said Am I in Gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the wombAnd she said Behold my maid Bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by herAnd she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife and Jacob went in unto herAnd Bilhah conceived and bare Jacob a sonAnd Rachel said God hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name DanAnd Bilhah Rachels maid conceived again and bare Jacob a second sonAnd Rachel said With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister and I have prevailed and she called his name NaphtaliWhen Leah saw that she had left bearing she took Zilpah her maid and gave her Jacob to wifeAnd Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob a sonAnd Leah said A troop cometh and she called his name GadAnd Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob a second sonAnd Leah said Happy am I for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name AsherAnd Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother Leah Then Rachel said to Leah Give me I pray thee of thy sons mandrakesAnd she said unto her Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also And Rachel said Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakesAnd Jacob came out of the field in the evening and Leah went out to meet him and said Thou must come in unto me for surely I have hired thee with my sons mandrakes And he lay with her that nightAnd God hearkened unto Leah and she conceived and bare Jacob the fifth sonAnd Leah said God hath given me my hire because I have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name IssacharAnd Leah conceived again and bare Jacob the sixth sonAnd Leah said God hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because I have born him six sons and she called his name ZebulunAnd afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name DinahAnd God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her wombAnd she conceived and bare a son and said God hath taken away my reproachAnd she called his name Joseph and said The LORD shall add to me another sonAnd it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob said unto Laban Send me away that I may go unto mine own place and to my countryGive me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which I have done theeAnd Laban said unto him I pray thee if I have found favour in thine eyes tarry for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sakeAnd he said Appoint me thy wages and I will give itAnd he said unto him Thou knowest how I have served thee and how thy cattle was with meFor it was little which thou hadst before I came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall I provide for mine own house alsoAnd he said What shall I give thee And Jacob said Thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me I will again feed and keep thy flockI will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hireSo shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with meAnd Laban said Behold I would it might be according to thy wordAnd he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sonsAnd he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocksAnd Jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rodsAnd he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drinkAnd the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spottedAnd Jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of Laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto Labans cattleAnd it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rodsBut when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were Labans and the stronger JacobsAnd the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and assesAnd he heard the words of Labans sons saying Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this gloryAnd Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not toward him as beforeAnd the LORD said unto Jacob Return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and I will be with theeAnd Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flockAnd said unto them I see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as before but the God of my father hath been with meAnd ye know that with all my power I have served your fatherAnd your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but God suffered him not to hurt meIf he said thus The speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus The ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstrakedThus God hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to meAnd it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisledAnd the angel of God spake unto me in a dream saying Jacob And I said Here am IAnd he said Lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto theeI am the God of Bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindredAnd Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers houseAre we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our moneyFor all the riches which God hath taken from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever God hath said unto thee doThen Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camelsAnd he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in Padan-aram for to go to Isaac his father in the land of CanaanAnd Laban went to shear his sheep and Rachel had stolen the images that were her fathersAnd Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian in that he told him not that he fledSo he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount GileadAnd it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fledAnd he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount GileadAnd God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night and said unto him Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or badThen Laban overtook Jacob Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of GileadAnd Laban said to Jacob What hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the swordWherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harpAnd hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doingIt is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight saying Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or badAnd now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my godsAnd Jacob answered and said to Laban Because I was afraid for I said Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from meWith whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen themAnd Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not Then went he out of Leahs tent and entered into Rachels tentNow Rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels furniture and sat upon them And Laban searched all the tent but found them notAnd she said to her father Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me And he searched but found not the imagesAnd Jacob was wroth and chode with Laban and Jacob answered and said to Laban What is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after meWhereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us bothThis twenty years have I been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have I not eatenThat which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee I bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by nightThus I was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyesThus have I been twenty years in thy house I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten timesExcept the God of my father the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternightAnd Laban answered and said unto Jacob These daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can I do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have bornNow therefore come thou let us make a covenant I and thou and let it be for a witness between me and theeAnd Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillarAnd Jacob said unto his brethren Gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heapAnd Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha but Jacob called it GaleedAnd Laban said This heap is a witness between me and thee this day Therefore was the name of it called GaleedAnd Mizpah for he said The LORD watch between me and thee when we are absent one from anotherIf thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see God is witness betwixt me and theeAnd Laban said to Jacob Behold this heap and behold this pillar which I have cast betwixt me and theeThis heap be witness and this pillar be witness that I will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harmThe God of Abraham and the God of Nahor the God of their father judge betwixt us And Jacob sware by the fear of his father IsaacThen Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mountAnd early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and Laban departed and returned unto his placeAnd Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met himAnd when Jacob saw them he said This is Gods host and he called the name of that place MahanaimAnd Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir the country of EdomAnd he commanded them saying Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau Thy servant Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until nowAnd I have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and I have sent to tell my lord that I may find grace in thy sightAnd the messengers returned to Jacob saying We came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with himThen Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bandsAnd said If Esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escapeAnd Jacob said O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the LORD which saidst unto me Return unto thy country and to thy kindred and I will deal well with theeI am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bandsDeliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the childrenAnd thou saidst I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitudeAnd he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brotherTwo hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty ramsThirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foalsAnd he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants Pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and droveAnd he commanded the foremost saying When Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying Whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before theeThen thou shalt say They be thy servant Jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord Esau and behold also he is behind usAnd so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find himAnd say ye moreover Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us For he said I will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward I will see his face peradventure he will accept of meSo went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the companyAnd he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford JabbokAnd he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he hadAnd Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the dayAnd when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with himAnd he said Let me go for the day breaketh And he said I will not let thee go except thou bless meAnd he said unto him What is thy name And he said JacobAnd he said Thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and hast prevailedAnd Jacob asked him and said Tell me I pray thee thy name And he said Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name And he blessed him thereAnd Jacob called the name of the place Peniel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preservedAnd as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thighTherefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of Jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrankAnd Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau came and with him four hundred men And he divided the children unto Leah and unto Rachel and unto the two handmaidsAnd he put the handmaids and their children foremost and Leah and her children after and Rachel and Joseph hindermostAnd he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brotherAnd Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they weptAnd he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said Who are those with thee And he said The children which God hath graciously given thy servantThen the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselvesAnd Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came Joseph near and Rachel and they bowed themselvesAnd he said What meanest thou by all this drove which I met And he said These are to find grace in the sight of my lordAnd Esau said I have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyselfAnd Jacob said Nay I pray thee if now I have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God and thou wast pleased with meTake I pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because God hath dealt graciously with me and because I have enough And he urged him and he took itAnd he said Let us take our journey and let us go and I will go before theeAnd he said unto him My lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will dieLet my lord I pray thee pass over before his servant and I will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until I come unto my lord unto SeirAnd Esau said Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me And he said What needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lordSo Esau returned that day on his way unto SeirAnd Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called SuccothAnd Jacob came to Shalem a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan when he came from Padan-aram and pitched his tent before the cityAnd he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of Hamor Shechems father for an hundred pieces of moneyAnd he erected there an altar and called it El-elohe-IsraelAnd Dinah the daughter of Leah which she bare unto Jacob went out to see the daughters of the landAnd when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled herAnd his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damselAnd Shechem spake unto his father Hamor saying Get me this damsel to wifeAnd Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and Jacob held his peace until they were comeAnd Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with himAnd the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be doneAnd Hamor communed with them saying The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter I pray you give her him to wifeAnd make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto youAnd ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions thereinAnd Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren Let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me I will giveAsk me never so much dowry and gift and I will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wifeAnd the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled Dinah their sisterAnd they said unto them We cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto usBut in this will we consent unto you If ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcisedThen will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one peopleBut if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be goneAnd their words pleased Hamor and Shechem Hamors sonAnd the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in Jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his fatherAnd Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city sayingThese men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughtersOnly herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcisedShall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with usAnd unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his cityAnd it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the malesAnd they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Shechems house and went outThe sons of Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sisterThey took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the fieldAnd all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the houseAnd Jacob said to Simeon and Levi Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the Perizzites and I being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and I shall be destroyed I and my houseAnd they said Should he deal with our sister as with an harlotAnd God said unto Jacob Arise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brotherThen Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him Put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garmentsAnd let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I wentAnd they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by ShechemAnd they journeyed and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of JacobSo Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan that is Bethel he and all the people that were with himAnd he built there an altar and called the place El-beth-el because there God appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brotherBut Deborah Rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak and the name of it was called Allon-bachuthAnd God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram and blessed himAnd God said unto him Thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called any more Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name IsraelAnd God said unto him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loinsAnd the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac to thee I will give it and to thy seed after thee will I give the landAnd God went up from him in the place where he talked with himAnd Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereonAnd Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him BethelAnd they journeyed from Bethel and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath and Rachel travailed and she had hard labourAnd it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her Fear not thou shalt have this son alsoAnd it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name Ben-oni but his father called him BenjaminAnd Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrath which is BethlehemAnd Jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of Rachels grave unto this dayAnd Israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of EdarAnd it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine and Israel heard it Now the sons of Jacob were twelveThe sons of Leah Reuben Jacobs firstborn and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and ZebulunThe sons of Rachel Joseph and BenjaminAnd the sons of Bilhah Rachels

the father of the EdomitesAnd Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of CanaanThese are the generations of Jacob Joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his fathers wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil reportNow Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many coloursAnd when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto himAnd Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the moreAnd he said unto them Hear I pray you this dream which I have dreamedFor behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheafAnd his brethren said to him Shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his wordsAnd he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said Behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to meAnd he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him What is this dream that thou hast dreamed Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earthAnd his brethren envied him but his father observed the sayingAnd his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in ShechemAnd Israel said unto Joseph Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem come and I will send thee unto them And he said to him Here am IAnd he said to him Go I pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron and he came to ShechemAnd a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying What seekest thouAnd he said I seek my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed their flocksAnd the man said They are departed hence for I heard them say Let us go to Dothan And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in DothanAnd when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay himAnd they said one to another Behold this dreamer comethCome now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say Some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreamsAnd Reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said Let us not kill himAnd Reuben said unto them Shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father againAnd it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that was on himAnd they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in itAnd they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to EgyptAnd Judah said unto his brethren What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his bloodCome and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh And his brethren were contentThen there passed by Midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into EgyptAnd Reuben returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothesAnd he returned unto his brethren and said The child is not and I whither shall I goAnd they took Josephs coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the bloodAnd they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said This have we found know now whether it be thy sons coat or noAnd he knew it and said It is my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him Joseph is without doubt rent in piecesAnd Jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many daysAnd all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning Thus his father wept for himAnd the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar an officer of Pharaohs and captain of the guardAnd it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain Adullamite whose name was HirahAnd Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shuah and he took her and went in unto herAnd she conceived and bare a son and he called his name ErAnd she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name OnanAnd she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name Shelah and he was at Chezib when she bare himAnd Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn whose name was TamarAnd Er Judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the LORD and the LORD slew himAnd Judah said unto Onan Go in unto thy brothers wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brotherAnd Onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brotherAnd the thing which he did displeased the LORD wherefore he slew him alsoThen said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law Remain a widow at thy fathers house till Shelah my son be grown for he said Lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers houseAnd in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judahs wife died and Judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath he and his friend Hirah the AdullamiteAnd it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheepAnd she put her widows garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to Timnath for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wifeWhen Judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her faceAnd he turned unto her by the way and said Go to I pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law And she said What wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto meAnd he said I will send thee a kid from the flock And she said Wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send itAnd he said What pledge shall I give thee And she said Thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand And he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by himAnd she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhoodAnd Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her notThen he asked the men of that place saying Where is the harlot that was openly by the way side And they said There was no harlot in this placeAnd he returned to Judah and said I cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this placeAnd Judah said Let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold I sent this kid and thou hast not found herAnd it came to pass about three months after that it was told Judah saying Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom And Judah said Bring her forth and let her be burntWhen she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying By the man whose these are am I with child and she said Discern I pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staffAnd Judah acknowledged them and said She hath been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Shelah my son And he knew her again no moreAnd it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her wombAnd it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying This came out firstAnd it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said How hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called PharezAnd afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called ZarahAnd Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh captain of the guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites which had brought him down thitherAnd the LORD was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the EgyptianAnd his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his handAnd Joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his handAnd it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the LORD blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house and in the fieldAnd he left all that he had in Josephs hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat And Joseph was a goodly person and well favouredAnd it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said Lie with meBut he refused and said unto his masters wife Behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my handThere is none greater in this house than I neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against GodAnd it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with herAnd it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there withinAnd she caught him by his garment saying Lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him outAnd it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forthThat she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying See he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and I cried with a loud voiceAnd it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him outAnd she laid up his garment by her until his lord came homeAnd she spake unto him according to these words saying The Hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock meAnd it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled outAnd it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying After this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindledAnd Josephs master took him and put him into the prison a place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prisonBut the LORD was with Joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prisonAnd the keeper of the prison committed to Josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of itThe keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the LORD was with him and that which he did the LORD made it to prosperAnd it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of EgyptAnd Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakersAnd he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where Joseph was boundAnd the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in wardAnd they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were bound in the prisonAnd Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sadAnd he asked Pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of his lords house saying Wherefore look ye so sadly to dayAnd they said unto him We have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it And Joseph said unto them Do not interpretations belong to God tell me them I pray youAnd the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him In my dream behold a vine was before meAnd in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapesAnd Pharaohs cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaohs cup and I gave the cup into Pharaohs handAnd Joseph said unto him This is the interpretation of it The three branches are three daysYet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver Pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butlerBut think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness I pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto Pharaoh and bring me out of this houseFor indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeonWhen the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto Joseph I also was in my dream and behold I had three white baskets on my headAnd in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my headAnd Joseph answered and said This is the interpretation thereof The three baskets are three daysYet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off theeAnd it came to pass the third day which was Pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servantsAnd he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into Pharaohs handBut he hanged the chief baker as Joseph had interpreted to themYet did not the chief butler remember Joseph but forgat himAnd it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the riverAnd behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadowAnd behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the riverAnd the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine So Pharaoh awokeAnd he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and goodAnd behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after themAnd the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears And Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dreamAnd it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto PharaohThen spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh saying I do remember my faults this dayPharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief bakerAnd we dreamed a dream in one night I and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dreamAnd there was there with us a young man an Hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpretAnd it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hangedThen Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto PharaohAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret itAnd Joseph answered Pharaoh saying It is not in me God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peaceAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph In my dream behold I stood upon the bank of the riverAnd behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadowAnd behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badnessAnd the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kineAnd when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning So I awokeAnd I saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and goodAnd behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after themAnd the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and I told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to meAnd Joseph said unto Pharaoh The dream of Pharaoh is one God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to doThe seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is oneAnd the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famineThis is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh What God is about to do he sheweth unto PharaohBehold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of EgyptAnd there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume the landAnd the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievousAnd for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to passNow therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of EgyptLet Pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous yearsAnd let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the citiesAnd that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt that the land perish not through the famineAnd the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servantsAnd Pharaoh said unto his servants Can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the Spirit of God isAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou artThou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thouAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph See I have set thee over all the land of EgyptAnd Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neckAnd he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him Bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of EgyptAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am Pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of EgyptAnd Pharaoh called Josephs name Zaphnath-paaneah and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On And Joseph went out over all the land of EgyptAnd Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of EgyptAnd in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulsAnd he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the sameAnd Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without numberAnd unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto himAnd Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh For God said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers houseAnd the name of the second called he Ephraim For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my afflictionAnd the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were endedAnd the seven years of dearth began to come according as Joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of Egypt there was breadAnd when all the land of Egypt was famished the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians Go unto Joseph what he saith to you doAnd the famine was over all the face of the earth and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of EgyptAnd all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all landsNow when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons Why do ye look one upon anotherAnd he said Behold I have heard that there is corn in Egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not dieAnd Josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in EgyptBut Benjamin Josephs brother Jacob sent not with his brethren for he said Lest peradventure mischief befall himAnd the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of CanaanAnd Joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and Josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earthAnd Joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them Whence come ye And they said From the land of Canaan to buy foodAnd Joseph knew his brethren but they knew not himAnd Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them Ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are comeAnd they said unto him Nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants comeWe are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spiesAnd he said unto them Nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are comeAnd they said Thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of Canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is notAnd Joseph said unto them That is it that I spake unto you saying Ye are spiesHereby ye shall be proved By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hitherSend one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spiesAnd he put them all together into ward three daysAnd Joseph said unto them the third day This do and live for I fear GodIf ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your housesBut bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die And they did soAnd they said one to another We are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon usAnd Reuben answered them saying Spake I not unto you saying Do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is requiredAnd they knew not that Joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreterAnd he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyesThen Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto themAnd they laded their asses with the corn and departed thenceAnd as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouthAnd he said unto his brethren My money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another What is this that God hath done unto usAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan and told him all that befell unto them sayingThe man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the countryAnd we said unto him We are true men we are no spiesWe be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of CanaanAnd the man the lord of the country said unto us Hereby shall I know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be goneAnd bring your youngest brother unto me then shall I know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will I deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the landAnd it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraidAnd Jacob their father said unto them Me have ye bereaved of my children Joseph is not and Simeon is not and ye will take Benjamin away all these things are against meAnd Reuben spake unto his father saying Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to thee againAnd he said My son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the graveAnd the famine was sore in the landAnd it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt their father said unto them Go again buy us a little foodAnd Judah spake unto him saying The man did solemnly protest unto us saying Ye shall not see my face except your brother be with youIf thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee foodBut if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us Ye shall not see my face except your brother be with youAnd Israel said Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brotherAnd they said The man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying Is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say Bring your brother downAnd Judah said unto Israel his father Send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little onesI will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for everFor except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second timeAnd their father Israel said unto them If it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almondsAnd take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversightTake also your brother and arise go again unto the manAnd God Almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin If I be bereaved of my children I am bereavedAnd the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before JosephAnd when Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house Bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noonAnd the man did as Joseph bade and the man brought the men into Josephs houseAnd the men were afraid because they were brought into Josephs house and they said Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our assesAnd they came near to the steward of Josephs house and they communed with him at the door of the houseAnd said O sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy foodAnd it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our handAnd other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacksAnd he said Peace be to you fear not your God and the God of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks I had your money And he brought Simeon out unto themAnd the man brought the men into Josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provenderAnd they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread thereAnd when Joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earthAnd he asked them of their welfare and said Is your father well the old man of whom ye spake Is he yet aliveAnd they answered Thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive And they bowed down their heads and made obeisanceAnd he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his mothers son and said Is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me And he said God be gracious unto thee my sonAnd Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept thereAnd he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said Set on breadAnd they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews for that is an abomination unto the EgyptiansAnd they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at anotherAnd he took and sent messes unto them from before him but Benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs And they drank and were merry with himAnd he commanded the steward of his house saying Fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouthAnd put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money And he did according to the word that Joseph had spokenAs soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their assesAnd when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off Joseph said unto his steward Up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for goodIs not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doingAnd he overtook them and he spake unto them these same wordsAnd they said unto him Wherefore saith my lord these words God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thingBehold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or goldWith whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords bondmenAnd he said Now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blamelessThen they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sackAnd he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in Benjamins sackThen they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the cityAnd Judah and his brethren came to Josephs house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the groundAnd Joseph said unto them What deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divineAnd Judah said What shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also with whom the cup is foundAnd he said God forbid that I should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your fatherThen Judah came near unto him and said Oh my lord let thy servant I pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as PharaohMy lord asked his servants saying Have ye a father or a brotherAnd we said unto my lord We have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth himAnd thou saidst unto thy servants Bring him down unto me that I may set mine eyes upon himAnd we said unto my lord The lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would dieAnd thou saidst unto thy servants Except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no moreAnd it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lordAnd our father said Go again and buy us a little foodAnd we said We cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother be with usAnd thy servant my father said unto us Ye know that my wife bare me two sonsAnd the one went out from me and I said Surely he is torn in pieces and I saw him not sinceAnd if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the graveNow therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads lifeIt shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the graveFor thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying If I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father for everNow therefore I pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethrenFor how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my fatherThen Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried Cause every man to go out from me And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethrenAnd he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heardAnd Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph doth my father yet live And his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presenceAnd Joseph said unto his brethren Come near to me I pray you And they came near And he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into EgyptNow therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve lifeFor these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvestAnd God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliveranceSo now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of EgyptHaste ye and go up to my father and say unto him Thus saith thy son Joseph God hath made me lord of all Egypt come down unto me tarry notAnd thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hastAnd there will I nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to povertyAnd behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto youAnd ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hitherAnd he fell upon his brother Benjamins neck and wept and Benjamin wept upon his neckMoreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with himAnd the fame thereof was heard in Pharaohs house saying Josephs brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well and his servantsAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph Say unto thy brethren This do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of CanaanAnd take your father and your households and come unto me and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the landNow thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and comeAlso regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of Egypt is yoursAnd the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of Pharaoh and gave them provision for the wayTo all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raimentAnd to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the waySo he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them See that ye fall not out by the wayAnd they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their fatherAnd told him saying Joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of Egypt And Jacobs heart fainted for he believed them notAnd they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revivedAnd Israel said It is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before I dieAnd Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father IsaacAnd God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob And he said Here am IAnd he said I am God the God of thy father fear not to go down into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nationI will go down with thee into Egypt and I will also surely bring thee up again and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyesAnd Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry himAnd they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and all his seed with himHis sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into EgyptAnd these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt Jacob and his sons Reuben Jacobs firstbornAnd the sons of Reuben Hanoch and Phallu and Hezron and CarmiAnd the sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish womanAnd the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and MerariAnd the sons of Judah Er and Onan and Shelah and Pharez and Zerah but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and HamulAnd the sons of Issachar Tola and Phuvah and Job and ShimronAnd the sons of Zebulun Sered and Elon and JahleelThese be the sons of Leah which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram with his daughter Dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and threeAnd the sons of Gad Ziphion and Haggi Shuni and Ezbon Eri and Arodi and AreliAnd the sons of Asher Jimnah and Ishuah and Isui and Beriah and Serah their sister and the sons of Beriah Heber and MalchielThese are the sons of Zilpah whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter and these she bare unto Jacob even sixteen soulsThe sons of Rachel Jacobs wife Joseph and BenjaminAnd unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto himAnd the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel Gera and Naaman Ehi and Rosh Muppim and Huppim and ArdThese are the sons of Rachel which were born to Jacob all the souls were fourteenAnd the sons of Dan HushimAnd the sons of Naphtali Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and ShillemThese are the sons of Bilhah which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter and she bare these unto Jacob all the souls were sevenAll the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt which came out of his loins besides Jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore and sixAnd the sons of Joseph which were born him in Egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of Jacob which came into Egypt were threescore and tenAnd he sent Judah before him unto Joseph to direct his face unto Goshen and they came into the land of GoshenAnd Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father to Goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good whileAnd Israel said unto Joseph Now let me die since I have seen thy face because thou art yet aliveAnd Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house I will go up and shew Pharaoh and say unto him My brethren and my fathers house which were in the land of Canaan are come unto meAnd the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they haveAnd it shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say What is your occupationThat ye shall say Thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the EgyptiansThen Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said My father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of Canaan and behold they are in the land of GoshenAnd he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto PharaohAnd Pharaoh said unto his brethren What is your occupation And they said unto Pharaoh Thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathersThey said moreover unto Pharaoh For to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of GoshenAnd Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying Thy father and thy brethren are come unto theeThe land of Egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of Goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattleAnd Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh and Jacob blessed PharaohAnd Pharaoh said unto Jacob How old art thouAnd Jacob said unto Pharaoh The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimageAnd Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from before PharaohAnd Joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land in the land of Rameses as Pharaoh had commandedAnd Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to their familiesAnd there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famineAnd Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they bought and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohs houseAnd when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said Give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money failethAnd Joseph said Give your cattle and I will give you for your cattle if money failAnd they brought their cattle unto Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that yearWhen that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him We will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our landsWherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolateAnd Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh for the Egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became PharaohsAnd as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereofOnly the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their landsThen Joseph said unto the people Behold I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the landAnd it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little onesAnd they said Thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be Pharaohs servantsAnd Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not PharaohsAnd Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedinglyAnd Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven yearsAnd the time drew nigh that Israel must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto him If now I have found grace in thy sight put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not I pray thee in EgyptBut I will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their buryingplace And he said I will do as thou hast saidAnd he said Swear unto me And he sware unto him And Israel bowed himself upon the beds headAnd it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph Behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons Manasseh and EphraimAnd one told Jacob and said Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bedAnd Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed meAnd said unto me Behold I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and I will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possessionAnd now thy two sons Ephraim and Manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt are mine as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mineAnd thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritanceAnd as for me when I came from Padan Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath the same is BethlehemAnd Israel beheld Josephs sons and said Who are theseAnd Joseph said unto his father They are my sons whom God hath given me in this place And he said Bring them I pray thee unto me and I will bless themNow the eyes of Israel were dim for age so that he could not see And he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced themAnd Israel said unto Joseph I had not thought to see thy face and lo God hath shewed me also thy seedAnd Joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earthAnd Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand toward Israels left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels right hand and brought them near unto himAnd Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon Manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for Manasseh was the firstbornAnd he blessed Joseph and said God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk the God which fed me all my life long unto this dayThe Angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earthAnd when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from Ephraims head unto Manassehs headAnd Joseph said unto his father Not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his headAnd his father refused and said I know it my son I know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nationsAnd he blessed them that day saying In thee shall Israel bless saying God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh and he set Ephraim before ManassehAnd Israel said unto Joseph Behold I die but God shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathersMoreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bowAnd Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last daysGather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your fatherReuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of powerUnstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couchSimeon and Levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitationsO my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wallCursed be their

father who shall help thee and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the wombThe blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethrenBenjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoilAll these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed themAnd he charged them and said unto them I am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the HittiteIn the cave that is in the field of Machpelah which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplaceThere they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried LeahThe purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of HethAnd when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his peopleAnd Joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed himAnd Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed IsraelAnd forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten daysAnd when the days of his mourning were past Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh saying If now I have found grace in your eyes speak I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh sayingMy father made me swear saying Lo I die in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan there shalt thou bury me Now therefore let me go up I pray thee and bury my father and I will come againAnd Pharaoh said Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swearAnd Joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of EgyptAnd all the house of Joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of GoshenAnd there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great companyAnd they came to the threshingfloor of Atad which is beyond Jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven daysAnd when the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of Atad they said This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim which is beyond JordanAnd his sons did unto him according as he commanded themFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite before MamreAnd Joseph returned into Egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his fatherAnd when Josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said Joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto himAnd they sent a messenger unto Joseph saying Thy father did command before he died sayingSo shall ye say unto Joseph Forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father And Joseph wept when they spake unto himAnd his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said Behold we be thy servantsAnd Joseph said unto them Fear not for am I in the place of GodBut as for you ye thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people aliveNow therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones And he comforted them and spake kindly unto themAnd Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his fathers house and Joseph lived an hundred and ten yearsAnd Joseph saw Ephraims children of the third generation the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Josephs kneesAnd Joseph said unto his brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham to Isaac and to JacobAnd Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from henceSo Joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in EgyptNow these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man and his household came with JacobReuben Simeon Levi and JudahIssachar Zebulun and BenjaminDan and Naphtali Gad and AsherAnd all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls for Joseph was in Egypt alreadyAnd Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generationAnd the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with themNow there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not JosephAnd he said unto his people Behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than weCome on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the landTherefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities Pithom and RaamsesBut the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew And they were grieved because of the children of IsraelAnd the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigourAnd they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigourAnd the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other PuahAnd he said When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall liveBut the midwives feared God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children aliveAnd the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them Why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children aliveAnd the midwives said unto Pharaoh Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto themTherefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mightyAnd it came to pass because the midwives feared God that he made them housesAnd Pharaoh charged all his people saying Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save aliveAnd there went a man of the house of Levi and took to wife a daughter of LeviAnd the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three monthsAnd when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brinkAnd his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to himAnd the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch itAnd when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept And she had compassion on him and said This is one of the Hebrews childrenThen said his sister to Pharaohs daughter Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for theeAnd Pharaohs daughter said to her Go And the maid went and called the childs motherAnd Pharaohs daughter said unto her Take this child away and nurse it for me and I will give thee thy wages And the woman took the child and nursed itAnd the child grew and she brought him unto Pharaohs daughter and he became her son And she called his name Moses and she said Because I drew him out of the waterAnd it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew one of his brethrenAnd he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sandAnd when he went out the second day behold two men of the Hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong Wherefore smitest thou thy fellowAnd he said Who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the Egyptian And Moses feared and said Surely this thing is knownNow when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a wellNow the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flockAnd the shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flockAnd when they came to Reuel their father he said How is it that ye are come so soon to dayAnd they said An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flockAnd he said unto his daughters And where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat breadAnd Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughterAnd she bare him a son and he called his name Gershom for he said I have been a stranger in a strange landAnd it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondageAnd God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with JacobAnd God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto themNow Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to HorebAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumedAnd Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burntAnd when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses And he said Here am IAnd he said Draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy groundMoreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob And Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon GodAnd the LORD said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrowsAnd I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the JebusitesNow therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress themCome now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of EgyptAnd Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of EgyptAnd he said Certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountainAnd Moses said unto God Behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me What is his name what shall I say unto themAnd God said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto youAnd God said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel The LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generationsGo and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them The LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in EgyptAnd I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honeyAnd they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto him The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our GodAnd I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty handAnd I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you goAnd I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go emptyBut every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the EgyptiansAnd Moses answered and said But behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say The LORD hath not appeared unto theeAnd the LORD said unto him What is that in thine hand And he said A rodAnd he said Cast it on the ground And he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before itAnd the LORD said unto Moses Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail And he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his handThat they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto theeAnd the LORD said furthermore unto him Put now thine hand into thy bosom And he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snowAnd he said Put thine hand into thy bosom again And he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other fleshAnd it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter signAnd it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry landAnd Moses said unto the LORD O my Lord I am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongueAnd the LORD said unto him Who hath made mans mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the LORDNow therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt sayAnd he said O my Lord send I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt sendAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother I know that he can speak well And also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heartAnd thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall doAnd he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of GodAnd thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signsAnd Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law and said unto him Let me go I pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt and see whether they be yet alive And Jethro said to Moses Go in peaceAnd the LORD said unto Moses in Midian Go return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy lifeAnd Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his handAnd the LORD said unto Moses When thou goest to return into Egypt see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand but I will harden his heart that he shall not let the people goAnd thou shalt say unto Pharaoh Thus saith the LORD Israel is my son even my firstbornAnd I say unto thee Let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy firstbornAnd it came to pass by the way in the inn that the LORD met him and sought to kill himThen Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said Surely a bloody husband art thou to meSo he let him go then she said A bloody husband thou art because of the circumcisionAnd the LORD said to Aaron Go into the wilderness to meet Moses And he went and met him in the mount of God and kissed himAnd Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded himAnd Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of IsraelAnd Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the peopleAnd the people believed and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshippedAnd afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wildernessAnd Pharaoh said Who is the LORD that I should obey his voice to let Israel go I know not the LORD neither will I let Israel goAnd they said The God of the Hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the LORD our God lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the swordAnd the king of Egypt said unto them Wherefore do ye Moses and Aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdensAnd Pharaoh said Behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdensAnd Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers sayingYe shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselvesAnd the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying Let us go and sacrifice to our GodLet there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard vain wordsAnd the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying Thus saith Pharaoh I will not give you strawGo ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminishedSo the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of strawAnd the taskmasters hasted them saying Fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was strawAnd the officers of the children of Israel which Pharaohs taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretoforeThen the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh saying Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servantsThere is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us Make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own peopleBut he said Ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORDGo therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricksAnd the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily taskAnd they met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from PharaohAnd they said unto them The LORD look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay usAnd Moses returned unto the LORD and said Lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent meFor since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at allThen the LORD said unto Moses Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his landAnd God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the LORDAnd I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to themAnd I have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangersAnd I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my covenantWherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the LORD and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgmentsAnd I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the EgyptiansAnd I will bring you in unto the land concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give it you for an heritage I am the LORDAnd Moses spake so unto the children of Israel but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondageAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingGo in speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt that he let the children of Israel go out of his landAnd Moses spake before the LORD saying Behold the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall Pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lipsAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of the land of EgyptThese be the heads of their fathers houses The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel Hanoch and Pallu Hezron and Carmi these be the families of ReubenAnd the sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman these are the families of SimeonAnd these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations Gershon and Kohath and Merari and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven yearsThe sons of Gershon Libni and Shimi according to their familiesAnd the sons of Kohath Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three yearsAnd the sons of Merari Mahali and Mushi these are the families of Levi according to their generationsAnd Amram took him Jochebed his fathers sister to wife and she bare him Aaron and Moses and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven yearsAnd the sons of Izhar Korah and Nepheg and ZichriAnd the sons of Uzziel Mishael and Elzaphan and ZithriAnd Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab sister of Naashon to wife and she bare him Nadab and Abihu Eleazar and IthamarAnd the sons of Korah Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph these are the families of the KorhitesAnd Eleazar Aarons son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife and she bare him Phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their familiesThese are that Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armiesThese are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt these are that Moses and AaronAnd it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of EgyptThat the LORD spake unto Moses saying I am the LORD speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto theeAnd Moses said before the LORD Behold I am of uncircumcised lips and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto meAnd the LORD said unto Moses See I have made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophetThou shalt speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh that he send the children of Israel out of his landAnd I will harden Pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of EgyptBut Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgmentsAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among themAnd Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them so did theyAnd Moses was fourscore years old and Aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto PharaohAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron sayingWhen Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying Shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto Aaron Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh and it shall become a serpentAnd Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh and they did so as the LORD had commanded and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpentThen Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of Egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantmentsFor they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but Aarons rod swallowed up their rodsAnd he hardened Pharaohs heart that he hearkened not unto them as the LORD had saidAnd the LORD said unto Moses Pharaohs heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people goGet thee unto Pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine handAnd thou shalt say unto him The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying Let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hearThus saith the LORD In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD behold I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to bloodAnd the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the riverAnd the LORD spake unto Moses Say unto Aaron Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stoneAnd Moses and Aaron did so as the LORD commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to bloodAnd the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of EgyptAnd the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments and Pharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the LORD had saidAnd Pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this alsoAnd all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the riverAnd seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the riverAnd the LORD spake unto Moses Go unto Pharaoh and say unto him Thus saith the LORD Let my people go that they may serve meAnd if thou refuse to let them go behold I will smite all thy borders with frogsAnd the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughsAnd the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servantsAnd the LORD spake unto Moses Say unto Aaron Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of EgyptAnd Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of EgyptAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of EgyptThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said Intreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and I will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the LORDAnd Moses said unto Pharaoh Glory over me when shall I intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river onlyAnd he said To morrow And he said Be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our GodAnd the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river onlyAnd Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against PharaohAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fieldsAnd they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stankBut when Pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the LORD had saidAnd the LORD said unto Moses Say unto Aaron Stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of EgyptAnd they did so for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of EgyptAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beastThen the magicians said unto Pharaoh This is the finger of God and Pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the LORD had saidAnd the LORD said unto Moses Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him Thus saith the LORD Let my people go that they may serve meElse if thou wilt not let my people go behold I will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they areAnd I will sever in that day the land of Goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earthAnd I will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign beAnd the LORD did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of fliesAnd Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said Go ye sacrifice to your God in the landAnd Moses said It is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone usWe will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command usAnd Pharaoh said I will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for meAnd Moses said Behold I go out from thee and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh from his servants and from his people to morrow but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORDAnd Moses went out from Pharaoh and intreated the LORDAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not oneAnd Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would he let the people goThen the LORD said unto Moses Go in unto Pharaoh and tell him Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews Let my people go that they may serve meFor if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them stillBehold the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrainAnd the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the childrens of IsraelAnd the LORD appointed a set time saying To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the landAnd the LORD did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of Egypt died but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not oneAnd Pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people goAnd the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of PharaohAnd it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of EgyptAnd they took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beastAnd the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the EgyptiansAnd the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the LORD had spoken unto MosesAnd the LORD said unto Moses Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say unto him Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews Let my people go that they may serve meFor I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earthFor now I will stretch out my hand that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earthAnd in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earthAs yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them goBehold to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until nowSend therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall dieHe that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the housesAnd he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the fieldAnd the LORD said unto Moses Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of EgyptAnd Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the LORD sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the LORD rained hail upon the land of EgyptSo there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nationAnd the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the fieldOnly in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were was there no hailAnd Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them I have sinned this time the LORD is righteous and I and my people are wickedIntreat the LORD for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and I will let you go and ye shall stay no longerAnd Moses said unto him As soon as I am gone out of the city I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORDsBut as for thee and thy servants I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD GodAnd the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolledBut the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown upAnd Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earthAnd when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servantsAnd the heart of Pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of Israel go as the LORD had spoken by MosesAnd the LORD said unto Moses Go in unto Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that I might shew these my signs before himAnd that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons son what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them that ye may know how that I am the LORDAnd Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve meElse if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coastAnd they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the fieldAnd they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day And he turned himself and went out from PharaohAnd Pharaohs servants said unto him How long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the LORD their God knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyedAnd Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh and he said unto them Go serve the LORD your God but who are they that shall goAnd Moses said We will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the LORDAnd he said unto them Let the LORD be so with you as I will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before youNot so go now ye that are men and serve the LORD for that ye did desire And they were driven out from Pharaohs presenceAnd the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath leftAnd Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locustsAnd the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested in all the coasts of Egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be suchFor they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of EgyptThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste and he said I have sinned against the LORD your God and against youNow therefore forgive I pray thee my sin only this once and intreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death onlyAnd he went out from Pharaoh and intreated the LORDAnd the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red sea there remained not one locust in all the coasts of EgyptBut the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of Israel goAnd the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be feltAnd Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three daysThey saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellingsAnd Pharaoh called unto Moses and said Go ye serve the LORD only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with youAnd Moses said Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our GodOur cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God and we know not with what we must serve the LORD until we come thitherBut the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart and he would not let them goAnd Pharaoh said unto him Get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt dieAnd Moses said Thou hast spoken well I will see thy face again no moreAnd the LORD said unto Moses Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogetherSpeak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of goldAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaohs servants and in the sight of the peopleAnd Moses said Thus saith the LORD About midnight will I go out into the midst of EgyptAnd all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beastsAnd there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any moreBut against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and IsraelAnd all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying Get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that I will go out And he went out from Pharaoh in a great angerAnd the LORD said unto Moses Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of EgyptAnd Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh and the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his landAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt sayingThis month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to youSpeak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an houseAnd if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lambYour lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goatsAnd ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the eveningAnd they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat itAnd they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat itEat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereofAnd ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fireAnd thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the LORDs passoverFor I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the LORDAnd the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of EgyptAnd this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for everSeven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from IsraelAnd in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of youAnd ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for everIn the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at evenSeven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel whether he be a stranger or born in the landYe shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened breadThen Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passoverAnd ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morningFor the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the LORD will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite youAnd ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for everAnd it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this serviceAnd it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you What mean ye by this serviceThat ye shall say It is the sacrifice of the LORDs passover who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses And the people bowed the head and worshippedAnd the children of Israel went away and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron so did theyAnd it came to pass that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of Pharoah that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattleAnd Pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the Egyptians and there was a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house where there was not one deadAnd he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said Rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of Israel and go serve the LORD as ye have saidAlso take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me alsoAnd the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said We be all dead menAnd the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shouldersAnd the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raimentAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required And they spoiled the EgyptiansAnd the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside childrenAnd a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattleAnd they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victualNow the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty yearsAnd it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of EgyptIt is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generationsAnd the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron This is the ordinance of the passover There shall no stranger eat thereofBut every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereofA foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereofIn one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereofAll the congregation of Israel shall keep itAnd when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the LORD let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereofOne law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among youThus did all the children of Israel as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron so did theyAnd it came to pass the selfsame day that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armiesAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel both of man and of beast it is mineAnd Moses said unto the people Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eatenThis day came ye out in the month AbibAnd it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this monthSeven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORDUnleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quartersAnd thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of EgyptAnd it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the LORDs law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of EgyptThou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to yearAnd it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it theeThat thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the LORDsAnd every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeemAnd it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying What is this that thou shalt say unto him By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt from the house of bondageAnd it came to pass when Pharaoh would hardly let us go that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children I redeemAnd it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of EgyptAnd it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to EgyptBut God led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of EgyptAnd Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with youAnd they took their journey from Succoth and encamped in Etham in the edge of the wildernessAnd the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and nightHe took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the peopleAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the sea over against Baal-zephon before it shall ye encamp by the seaFor Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel They are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them inAnd I will harden Pharaohs heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh and upon all his host that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD And they did soAnd it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said Why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving usAnd he made ready his chariot and took his people with himAnd he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of themAnd the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with an high handBut the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth before Baal-zephonAnd when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORDAnd they said unto Moses Because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of EgyptIs not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wildernessAnd Moses said unto the people Fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the LORD which he will shew to you to day for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for everThe LORD shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peaceAnd the LORD said unto Moses Wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forwardBut lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the seaAnd I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemenAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemenAnd the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind themAnd it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the nightAnd Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were dividedAnd the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their leftAnd the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemenAnd it came to pass that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the EgyptiansAnd took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the Egyptians said Let us flee from the face of Israel for the LORD fighteth for them against the EgyptiansAnd the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemenAnd Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the seaAnd the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of themBut the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their leftThus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shoreAnd Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the LORD and believed the LORD and his servant MosesThen sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD and spake saying I will sing unto the LORD for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the seaThe LORD is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him an habitation my fathers God and I will exalt himThe LORD is a man of war the LORD is his namePharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red seaThe depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stoneThy right hand O LORD is become glorious in power thy right hand O LORD hath dashed in pieces the enemyAnd in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubbleAnd with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the seaThe enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy themThou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty watersWho is like unto thee O LORD among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wondersThou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed themThou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitationThe people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of PalestinaThen the dukes of Edom shall be amazed the mighty men of Moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt awayFear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over O LORD till the people pass over which thou hast purchasedThou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place O LORD which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the Sanctuary O Lord which thy hands have establishedThe LORD shall reign for ever and everFor the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the seaAnd Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancesAnd Miriam answered them Sing ye to the LORD for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the seaSo Moses brought Israel from the Red sea and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no waterAnd when they came to Marah they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called MarahAnd the people murmured against Moses saying What shall we drinkAnd he cried unto the LORD and the LORD shewed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved themAnd said If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and wilt do that which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the LORD that healeth theeAnd they came to Elim where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the watersAnd they took their journey from Elim and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of EgyptAnd the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wildernessAnd the children of Israel said unto them Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hungerThen said the LORD unto Moses Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or noAnd it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather dailyAnd Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel At even then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of EgyptAnd in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the LORD for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD and what are we that ye murmur against usAnd Moses said This shall be when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the LORDAnd Moses spake unto Aaron Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel Come near before the LORD for he hath heard your murmuringsAnd it came to pass as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloudAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingI have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel speak unto them saying At even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that I am the LORD your GodAnd it came to pass that at even the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the hostAnd when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the groundAnd when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another It is manna for they wist not what it was And Moses said unto them This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eatThis is the thing which the LORD hath commanded Gather of it every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tentsAnd the children of Israel did so and gathered some more some lessAnd when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eatingAnd Moses said Let no man leave of it till the morningNotwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and Moses was wroth with themAnd they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it meltedAnd it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told MosesAnd he said unto them This is that which the LORD hath said To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD bake that which ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morningAnd they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm thereinAnd Moses said Eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD to day ye shall not find it in the fieldSix days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be noneAnd it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found noneAnd the LORD said unto Moses How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my lawsSee for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh daySo the people rested on the seventh dayAnd the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honeyAnd Moses said This is the thing which the LORD commandeth Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of EgyptAnd Moses said unto Aaron Take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the LORD to be kept for your generationsAs the LORD commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be keptAnd the children of Israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of CanaanNow an omer is the tenth part of an ephahAnd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the LORD and pitched in Rephidim and there was no water for the people to drinkWherefore the people did chide with Moses and said Give us water that we may drink And Moses said unto them Why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the LORDAnd the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirstAnd Moses cried unto the LORD saying What shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to stone meAnd the LORD said unto Moses Go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and goBehold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of IsraelAnd he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted the LORD saying Is the LORD among us or notThen came Amalek and fought with Israel in RephidimAnd Moses said unto Joshua Choose us out men and go out fight with Amalek to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine handSo Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hillAnd it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailedBut Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sunAnd Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the swordAnd the LORD said unto Moses Write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heavenAnd Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah-nissiFor he said Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generationWhen Jethro the priest of Midian Moses father in law heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people and that the LORD had brought Israel out of EgyptThen Jethro Moses father in law took Zipporah Moses wife after he had sent her backAnd her two sons of which the name of the one was Gershom for he said I have been an alien in a strange landAnd the name of the other was Eliezer for the God of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of PharaohAnd Jethro Moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of GodAnd he said unto Moses I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with herAnd Moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tentAnd Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israels sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the LORD delivered themAnd Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the EgyptiansAnd Jethro said Blessed be the LORD who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the EgyptiansNow I know that the LORD is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above themAnd Jethro Moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God and Aaron came and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses father in law before GodAnd it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the eveningAnd when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said What is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto evenAnd Moses said unto his father in law Because the people come unto me to inquire of GodWhen they have a matter they come unto me and I judge between one and another and I do make them know the statutes of God and his lawsAnd Moses father in law said unto him The thing that thou doest is not goodThou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself aloneHearken now unto my voice I will give thee counsel and God shall be with thee Be thou for the people to Godward that thou mayest bring the causes unto GodAnd thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must doMoreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear God men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tensAnd let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with theeIf thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peaceSo Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had saidAnd Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tensAnd they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto Moses but every small matter they judged themselvesAnd Moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own landIn the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of SinaiFor they were departed from Rephidim and were come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there Israel camped before the mountAnd Moses went up unto God and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain saying Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of IsraelYe have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myselfNow therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mineAnd ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of IsraelAnd Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded himAnd all the people answered together and said All that the LORD hath spoken we will do And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORDAnd the LORD said unto Moses Lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee for ever And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORDAnd the LORD said unto Moses Go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothesAnd be ready against the third day for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount SinaiAnd thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying Take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to deathThere shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mountAnd Moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothesAnd he said unto the people Be ready against the third day come not at your wivesAnd it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembledAnd Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mountAnd mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatlyAnd when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a voiceAnd the LORD came down upon mount Sinai on the top of the mount and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount and Moses went upAnd the LORD said unto Moses Go down charge the people lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze and many of them perishAnd let the priests also which come near to the LORD sanctify themselves lest the LORD break forth upon themAnd Moses said unto the LORD The people cannot come up to mount Sinai for thou chargedst us saying Set bounds about the mount and sanctify itAnd the LORD said unto him Away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and Aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD lest he break forth upon themSo Moses went down unto the people and spake unto themAnd God spake all these words sayingI am the LORD thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondageThou shalt have no other gods before meThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earthThou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate meAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandmentsThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vainRemember the sabbath day to keep it holySix days shalt thou labour and do all thy workBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gatesFor in six days the LORD made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hallowed itHonour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth theeThou shalt not killThou shalt not commit adulteryThou shalt not stealThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbourThou shalt not covet thy neighbours house thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighboursAnd all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar offAnd they said unto Moses Speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we dieAnd Moses said unto the people Fear not for God is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin notAnd the people stood afar off and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God wasAnd the LORD said unto Moses Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heavenYe shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make unto you gods of goldAn altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where I record my

knowledge and in all manner of workmanshipTo devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brassAnd in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanshipAnd I behold I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded theeThe tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacleAnd the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incenseAnd the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the laver and his footAnd the cloths of service and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priests officeAnd the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place according to all that I have commanded thee shall they doAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak thou also unto the children of Israel saying Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify youYe shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his peopleSix days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the LORD whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to deathWherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenantIt is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshedAnd he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of GodAnd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him Up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we wot not what is become of himAnd Aaron said unto them Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto meAnd all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto AaronAnd he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said These be thy gods O Israel which brought thee up out of the land of EgyptAnd when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made proclamation and said To morrow is a feast to the LORDAnd they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to playAnd the LORD said unto Moses Go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselvesThey have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said These be thy gods O Israel which have brought thee up out of the land of EgyptAnd the LORD said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked peopleNow therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nationAnd Moses besought the LORD his God and said LORD why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty handWherefore should the Egyptians speak and say For mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth Turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy peopleRemember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for everAnd the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his peopleAnd Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they writtenAnd the tables were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God graven upon the tablesAnd when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto Moses There is a noise of war in the campAnd he said It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do I hearAnd it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and Moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mountAnd he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of Israel drink of itAnd Moses said unto Aaron What did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon themAnd Aaron said Let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischiefFor they said unto me Make us gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we wot not what is become of himAnd I said unto them Whosoever hath any gold let them break it off So they gave it me then I cast it into the fire and there came out this calfAnd when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemiesThen Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said Who is on the LORDs side let him come unto me And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto himAnd he said unto them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbourAnd the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand menFor Moses had said Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this dayAnd it came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the people Ye have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the LORD peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sinAnd Moses returned unto the LORD and said Oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of goldYet now if thou wilt forgive their sin-- and if not blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou hast writtenAnd the LORD said unto Moses Whosoever hath sinned against me him will I blot out of my bookTherefore now go lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee behold mine Angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon themAnd the LORD plagued the people because they made the calf which Aaron madeAnd the LORD said unto Moses Depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt unto the land which I sware unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying Unto thy seed will I give itAnd I will send an angel before thee and I will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite the Hivite and the JebusiteUnto a land flowing with milk and honey for I will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest I consume thee in the wayAnd when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornamentsFor the LORD had said unto Moses Say unto the children of Israel Ye are a stiffnecked people I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that I may know what to do unto theeAnd the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount HorebAnd Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation And it came to pass that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the campAnd it came to pass when Moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after Moses until he was gone into the tabernacleAnd it came to pass as Moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the LORD talked with MosesAnd all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent doorAnd the LORD spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend And he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of Nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacleAnd Moses said unto the LORD See thou sayest unto me Bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me Yet thou hast said I know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sightNow therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that I may know thee that I may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy peopleAnd he said My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee restAnd he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up henceFor wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earthAnd the LORD said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and I know thee by nameAnd he said I beseech thee shew me thy gloryAnd he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercyAnd he said Thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and liveAnd the LORD said Behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rockAnd it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that I will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass byAnd I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seenAnd the LORD said unto Moses Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakestAnd be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mountAnd no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountAnd he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stoneAnd the LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the LORDAnd the LORD passed by before him and proclaimed The LORD The LORD God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truthKeeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the childrens children unto the third and to the fourth generationAnd Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshippedAnd he said If now I have found grace in thy sight O Lord let my Lord I pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritanceAnd he said Behold I make a covenant before all thy people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD for it is a terrible thing that I will do with theeObserve thou that which I command thee this day behold I drive out before thee the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the JebusiteTake heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of theeBut ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their grovesFor thou shalt worship no other god for the LORD whose name is Jealous is a jealous GodLest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods  and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrificeAnd thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their godsThou shalt make thee no molten godsThe feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as I commanded thee in the time of the month Abib for in the month Abib thou camest out from EgyptAll that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is maleBut the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem And none shall appear before me emptySix days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt restAnd thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years endThrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD the God of IsraelFor I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the yearThou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morningThe first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milkAnd the LORD said unto Moses Write thou these words for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with IsraelAnd he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandmentsAnd it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with himAnd when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh himAnd Moses called unto them and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with themAnd afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount SinaiAnd till Moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his faceBut when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him he took the vail off until he came out And he came out and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commandedAnd the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses face shone and Moses put the vail upon his face again until he went in to speak with himAnd Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together and said unto them These are the words which the LORD hath commanded that ye should do themSix days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the LORD whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to deathYe shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath dayAnd Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel saying This is the thing which the LORD commanded sayingTake ye from among you an offering unto the LORD whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the LORD gold and silver and brassAnd blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hairAnd rams skins dyed red and badgers skins and shittim woodAnd oil for the light and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incenseAnd onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplateAnd every wise hearted among you shall come and make all that the LORD hath commandedThe tabernacle his tent and his covering his taches and his boards his bars his pillars and his socketsThe ark and the staves thereof with the mercy seat and the vail of the coveringThe table and his staves and all his vessels and the shewbreadThe candlestick also for the light and his furniture and his lamps with the oil for the lightAnd the incense altar and his staves and the anointing

door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd Moses said unto the congregation This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be doneAnd Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with waterAnd he put upon him the coat and girded him with the girdle and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod and bound it unto him therewithAnd he put the breastplate upon him also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the ThummimAnd he put the mitre upon his head also upon the mitre even upon his forefront did he put the golden plate the holy crown as the LORD commanded MosesAnd Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein and sanctified themAnd he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all his vessels both the laver and his foot to sanctify themAnd he poured of the anointing oil upon Aarons head and anointed him to sanctify himAnd Moses brought Aarons sons and put coats upon them and girded them with girdles and put bonnets upon them as the LORD commanded MosesAnd he brought the bullock for the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offeringAnd he slew it and Moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it to make reconciliation upon itAnd he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and caul above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and Moses burned it upon the altarBut the bullock and his hide his flesh and his dung he burnt with fire without the camp as the LORD commanded MosesAnd he brought the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and

thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their right feet and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round aboutAnd he took the fat and the rump and all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right shoulderAnd out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulderAnd he put all upon Aarons hands and upon his sons hands and waved them for a wave offering before the LORDAnd Moses took them from off their hands and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering they were consecrations for a sweet savour it is an offering made by fire unto the LORDAnd Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD for of the ram of consecration it was Moses part as the LORD commanded MosesAnd Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon his sons garments with him and sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons garments with himAnd Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations as I commanded saying Aaron and his sons shall eat itAnd that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fireAnd ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days until the days of your consecration be at an end for seven days shall he consecrate youAs he hath done this day so the LORD hath commanded to do to make an atonement for youTherefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the LORD that ye die not for so I am commandedSo Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of MosesAnd it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of IsraelAnd he said unto Aaron Take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering without blemish and offer them before the LORDAnd unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak saying Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of the first year without blemish for a burnt offeringAlso a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD and a meat offering mingled with oil for to day the LORD will appear unto youAnd they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORDAnd Moses said This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto youAnd Moses said unto Aaron Go unto the altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as the LORD commandedAaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himselfAnd the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altarBut the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as the LORD commanded MosesAnd the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the campAnd he slew the burnt offering and Aarons sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altarAnd they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altarAnd he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altarAnd he brought the peoples offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the firstAnd he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the mannerAnd he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morningHe slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and Aarons sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round aboutAnd the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liverAnd they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altarAnd the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD as Moses commandedAnd Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offeringsAnd Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the peopleAnd there came a fire out from before the LORD and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their facesAnd Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the LORD which he commanded them notAnd there went out fire from the LORD and devoured them and they died before the LORDThen Moses said unto Aaron This is it that the LORD spake saying I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people I will be glorified And Aaron held his peaceAnd Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron and said unto them Come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the campSo they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as Moses had saidAnd Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar his sons Uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of Israel bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindledAnd ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you And they did according to the word of MosesAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron sayingDo not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generationsAnd that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and cleanAnd that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of MosesAnd Moses spake unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar his sons that were left Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holyAnd ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire for so I am commandedAnd the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of IsraelThe heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the LORD hath commandedAnd Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron which were left alive sayingWherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the LORDBehold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as I commandedAnd Aaron said unto Moses Behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD and such things have befallen me and if I had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORDAnd when Moses heard that he was contentAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron saying unto themSpeak unto the children of Israel saying These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earthWhatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eatNevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the hoof

peopleI am the LORD your God which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go uprightBut if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandmentsAnd if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenantI also will do this unto you I will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your

times more plagues upon you according to your sinsI will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your highways shall be desolateAnd if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto meThen will I also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sinsAnd I will bring

enemyAnd when I have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfiedAnd if ye

therein shall be astonished at itAnd I will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities wasteThen shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbathsAs long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon itAnd upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursuethAnd they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemiesAnd ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you upAnd they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with themIf they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto meAnd that I also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquityThen will I remember my covenant with Jacob and also my covenant with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember and I will remember the landThe land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutesAnd yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies I will not cast them away neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for I am the LORD their GodBut I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen that I might be their God I am the LORDThese are the statutes and judgments and laws which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of MosesAnd the LORD spake unto Moses

money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to himAnd if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any moreBut the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy unto the LORD as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priestsAnd if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought which is not of the

LORDNone devoted which shall be devoted of men shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to deathAnd all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the LORDs

have done and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassedBut if the man have no kinsman to

husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the mannerAnd the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiledThen shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembranceAnd the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORDAnd the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the waterAnd the priest shall set the woman before the LORD and uncover the womans head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his

beside thine husbandThen the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swellAnd this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot And the woman shall say Amen amenAnd the

curse shall enter into her and become bitterThen the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the womans hand and shall wave the offering before the LORD and offer it upon the altarAnd the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the waterAnd when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her peopleAnd if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seedThis is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiledOr when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before the LORD and the priest shall execute upon her all this lawThen shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman shall bear her iniquityAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and say unto them When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite to separate themselves unto the LORDHe shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or driedAll the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the huskAll the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head growAll the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead bodyHe shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his God is upon his headAll the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORDAnd if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave itAnd on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same dayAnd he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiledAnd this is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd he shall offer his offering unto the LORD one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offeringsAnd a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat offering and their drink offeringsAnd the priest shall bring them before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offeringAnd he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offeringAnd the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offeringsAnd the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite after the hair of his separation is shavenAnd the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD this is holy for the priest with the wave breast and heave shoulder and after that the Nazarite may drink wineThis is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation beside that that his hand shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after the law of his separationAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto Aaron and unto his sons saying On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel saying unto themThe LORD bless thee and keep theeThe LORD make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto theeThe LORD lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peaceAnd they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless themAnd it came to pass on the day that Moses

four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon according to their serviceAnd four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari according unto their service under the hand of Ithamar the son of

speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto himAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto Aaron and say unto him When thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestickAnd Aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the LORD commanded MosesAnd this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses so he made the candlestickAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingTake the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse themAnd thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them Sprinkle water of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves cleanThen let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offeringAnd thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel togetherAnd thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the LevitesAnd Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel that they may execute the service of the LORDAnd the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the LORD to make an atonement for the LevitesAnd thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the LORDThus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel and the Levites shall be mineAnd after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offeringFor they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto meFor all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myselfAnd I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of IsraelAnd I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of Israel that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuaryAnd Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites so did the children of Israel unto themAnd the Levites were purified and they washed their clothes and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse themAnd after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron and before his sons as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites so did they unto themAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingThis is it that belongeth unto the Levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no moreBut shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their chargeAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt sayingLet the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed seasonIn the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep itAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel that they should keep the passoverAnd they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai according to all that the LORD commanded Moses so did the children of IsraelAnd there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that dayAnd those men said unto him We are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of IsraelAnd Moses said unto them Stand still and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning youAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel saying If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORDThe fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbsThey shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep itBut the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season that man shall bear his sinAnd if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the LORD according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the landAnd on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morningSo it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by nightAnd when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of Israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of Israel pitched their tentsAt the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tentsAnd when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and journeyed notAnd so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyedAnd so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyedOr whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of Israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyedAt the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed they kept the charge of the LORD at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of MosesAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingMake thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the campsAnd when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of the thousands of Israel shall gather themselves unto theeWhen ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forwardWhen ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeysBut when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarmAnd the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generationsAnd if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God and ye shall be saved from your enemiesAlso in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you for a memorial before your God I am the LORD your GodAnd it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimonyAnd the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of ParanAnd they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of MosesIn the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies and over his host was Nahshon the son of AmminadabAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of ZuarAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of HelonAnd the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward bearing the tabernacleAnd the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies and over his host was Elizur the son of ShedeurAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of ZurishaddaiAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of DeuelAnd the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and the other did set up the tabernacle against they cameAnd the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies and over his host was Elishama the son of AmmihudAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of PedahzurAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of GideoniAnd the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and over his host was Ahiezer the son of AmmishaddaiAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of OcranAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of EnanThus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies when they set forwardAnd Moses said unto Hobab the son of Raguel the Midianite Moses father in law We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said I will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the LORD hath spoken good concerning IsraelAnd he said unto him I will not go but I will depart to mine own land and to my kindredAnd he said Leave us not I pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to us instead of eyesAnd it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us the same will we do unto theeAnd they departed from the mount of the LORD three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days journey to search out a resting place for themAnd the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day when they went out of the campAnd it came to pass when the ark set forward that Moses said Rise up LORD and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before theeAnd when it rested he said Return O LORD unto the many thousands of IsraelAnd when the people complained it displeased the LORD and the LORD heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the LORD burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the campAnd the people cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the LORD the fire was quenchedAnd he called the name of the place Taberah because the fire of the LORD burnt among themAnd the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of Israel also wept again and said Who shall give us flesh to eatWe remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlickBut our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyesAnd the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as the colour of bdelliumAnd the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oilAnd when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon itThen Moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly Moses also was displeasedAnd Moses said unto the LORD Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon meHave I conceived all this people have I begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me Carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathersWhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying Give us flesh that we may eatI am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for meAnd if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of hand if I have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchednessAnd the LORD said unto Moses Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with theeAnd I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself aloneAnd say thou unto the people Sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD saying Who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in Egypt therefore the LORD will give you flesh and ye shall eatYe shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty daysBut even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you and have wept before him saying Why came we forth out of EgyptAnd Moses said The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole monthShall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice themAnd the LORD said unto Moses Is the LORDs hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or notAnd Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacleAnd the LORD came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not ceaseBut there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the campAnd there ran a young man and told Moses and said Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the campAnd Joshua the son of Nun the servant of Moses one of his young men answered and said My lord Moses forbid themAnd Moses said unto him Enviest thou for my sake would God that all the LORDs people were prophets and that the LORD would put his spirit upon themAnd Moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of IsraelAnd there went forth a wind from the LORD and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a days journey on this side and as it were a days journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earthAnd the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the campAnd while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people and the LORD smote the people with a very great plagueAnd he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah because there they buried the people that lustedAnd the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth and abode at HazerothAnd Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an Ethiopian womanAnd they said Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken also by us And the LORD heard itNow the man Moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earthAnd the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation And they three came outAnd the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forthAnd he said Hear now my words If there be a prophet among you I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dreamMy servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all mine houseWith him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant MosesAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against them and he departedAnd the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold Miriam became leprous white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam and behold she was leprousAnd Aaron said unto Moses Alas my lord I beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinnedLet her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers wombAnd Moses cried unto the LORD saying Heal her now O God I beseech theeAnd the LORD said unto Moses If her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in againAnd Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in againAnd afterward the people removed from Hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of ParanAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSend thou men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a ruler among themAnd Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran all those men were heads of the children of IsraelAnd these were their names of the tribe of Reuben Shammua the son of ZaccurOf the tribe of Simeon Shaphat the son of HoriOf the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of JephunnehOf the tribe of Issachar Igal the son of JosephOf the tribe of Ephraim Oshea the son of NunOf the tribe of Benjamin Palti the son of RaphuOf the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel the son of SodiOf the tribe of Joseph namely of the tribe of Manasseh Gaddi the son of SusiOf the tribe of Dan Ammiel the son of GemalliOf the tribe of Asher Sethur the son of MichaelOf the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi the son of VophsiOf the tribe of Gad Geuel the son of MachiThese are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun JehoshuaAnd Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them Get you up this way southward and go up into the mountainAnd see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or manyAnd what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holdsAnd what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not And be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapesSo they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob as men come to HamathAnd they ascended by the south and came unto Hebron where Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai the children of Anak were Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in EgyptAnd they came unto the brook of Eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figsThe place was called the brook Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thenceAnd they returned from searching of the land after forty daysAnd they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shewed them the fruit of the landAnd they told him and said We came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of itNevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of Anak thereThe Amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of JordanAnd Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said Let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome itBut the men that went up with him said We be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than weAnd they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying The land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great statureAnd there we saw the giants the sons of Anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sightAnd all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that nightAnd all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this wildernessAnd wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into EgyptAnd they said one to another Let us make a captain and let us return into EgyptThen Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of IsraelAnd Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rent their clothesAnd they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying The land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good landIf the LORD delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honeyOnly rebel not ye against the LORD neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from them and the LORD is with us fear them notBut all the congregation bade stone them with stones And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of IsraelAnd the LORD said unto Moses How long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which I have shewed among themI will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than theyAnd Moses said unto the LORD Then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among themAnd they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people that thou LORD art seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by nightNow if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak sayingBecause the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wildernessAnd now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou hast spoken sayingThe LORD is longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generationPardon I beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until nowAnd the LORD said I have pardoned according to thy wordBut as truly as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORDBecause all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voiceSurely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see itBut my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will I bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess itNow the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley To morrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red seaAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron sayingHow long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel which they murmur against meSay unto them As truly as I live saith the LORD as ye have spoken in mine ears so will I do to youYour carcases shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against meDoubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein save Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of NunBut your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despisedBut as for you your carcases they shall fall in this wildernessAnd your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the wildernessAfter the number of the days in which ye searched the land even forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my breach of promiseI the LORD have said I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall dieAnd the men which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the landEven those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the LORDBut Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land lived stillAnd Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel and the people mourned greatlyAnd they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the top of the mountain saying Lo we be here and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised for we have sinnedAnd Moses said Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD but it shall not prosperGo not up for the LORD is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemiesFor the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the LORD therefore the LORD will not be with youBut they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD and Moses departed not out of the campThen the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto HormahAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and say unto them When ye be come into the land of your habitations which I give unto youAnd will make an offering by fire unto the LORD a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts to make a sweet savour unto the LORD of the herd or of the flockThen shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oilAnd the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lambOr for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oilAnd for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the LORDAnd when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the LORDThen shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oilAnd thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the LORDThus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kidAccording to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to every one according to their numberAll that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the LORDAnd if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the LORD as ye do so he shall doOne ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the LORDOne law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with youAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and say unto them When ye come into the land whither I bring youThen it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORDYe shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall ye heave itOf the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generationsAnd if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the LORD hath spoken unto MosesEven all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the LORD commanded Moses and henceforward among your generationsThen it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD with his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner and one kid of the goats for a sin offeringAnd the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD and their sin offering before the LORD for their ignoranceAnd it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignoranceAnd if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offeringAnd the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven himYe shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among themBut the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the LORD and that soul shall be cut off from among his peopleBecause he hath despised the word of the LORD and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon himAnd while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath dayAnd they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregationAnd they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to himAnd the LORD said unto Moses The man shall be surely put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the campAnd all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the LORD commanded MosesAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blueAnd it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the LORD and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a whoringThat ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your GodI am the LORD your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God I am the LORD your GodNow Korah the son of Izhar the son of Kohath the son of Levi and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab and On the son of Peleth sons of Reuben took menAnd they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renownAnd they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them Ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the LORD is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORDAnd when Moses heard it he fell upon his faceAnd he spake unto Korah and unto all his company saying Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto himThis do Take you censers Korah and all his companyAnd put fire therein and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of LeviAnd Moses said unto Korah Hear I pray you ye sons of LeviSeemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister unto themAnd he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood alsoFor which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD and what is Aaron that ye murmur against himAnd Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab which said We will not come upIs it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over usMoreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come upAnd Moses was very wroth and said unto the LORD Respect not thou their offering I have not taken one ass from them neither have I hurt one of themAnd Moses said unto Korah Be thou and all thy company before the LORD thou and they and Aaron to morrowAnd take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and Aaron each of you his censerAnd they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and AaronAnd Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregationAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron sayingSeparate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume them in a momentAnd they fell upon their faces and said O God the God of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregationAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the congregation saying Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah Dathan and AbiramAnd Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram and the elders of Israel followed himAnd he spake unto the congregation saying Depart I pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sinsSo they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah Dathan and Abiram on every side and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little childrenAnd Moses said Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works for I have not done them of mine own mindIf these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the LORD hath not sent meBut if the LORD make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORDAnd it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under themAnd the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto Korah and all their goodsThey and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregationAnd all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said Lest the earth swallow us up alsoAnd there came out a fire from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incenseAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowedThe censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the LORD therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of IsraelAnd Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altarTo be a memorial unto the children of Israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron come near to offer incense before the LORD that he be not as Korah and as his company as the LORD said to him by the hand of MosesBut on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying Ye have killed the people of the LORDAnd it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appearedAnd Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregationAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingGet you up from among this congregation that I may consume them as in a moment And they fell upon their facesAnd Moses said unto Aaron Take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the LORD the plague is begunAnd Aaron took as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the peopleAnd he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayedNow they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of KorahAnd Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayedAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon his rodAnd thou shalt write Aarons name upon the rod of Levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathersAnd thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where I will meet with youAnd it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom I shall choose shall blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel whereby they murmur against youAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of Aaron was among their rodsAnd Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witnessAnd it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almondsAnd Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel and they looked and took every man his rodAnd the LORD said unto Moses Bring Aarons rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die notAnd Moses did so as the LORD commanded him so did heAnd the children of Israel spake unto Moses saying Behold we die we perish we all perishWhosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die shall we be consumed with dyingAnd the LORD said unto Aaron Thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthoodAnd thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witnessAnd they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also dieAnd they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto youAnd ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of IsraelAnd I behold I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel to you they are given as a gift for the LORD to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregationTherefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priests office for every thing of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve I have given your priests office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to deathAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron Behold I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for everThis shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sonsIn the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto theeAnd this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel I have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of itAll the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD them have I given theeAnd whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the LORD shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of itEvery thing devoted in Israel shall be thineEvery thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the LORD whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeemAnd those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahsBut the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the LORDAnd the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thineAll the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD have I given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with theeAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of IsraelAnd behold I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregationNeither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and dieBut the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of Israel they have no inheritanceBut the tithes of the children of Israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD I have given to the Levites to inherit therefore I have said unto them Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritanceAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingThus speak unto the Levites and say unto them When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD even a tenth part of the titheAnd this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepressThus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel and ye shall give thereof the LORDs heave offering to Aaron the priestOut of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of itTherefore thou shalt say unto them When ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepressAnd ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregationAnd ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel lest ye dieAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron sayingThis is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yokeAnd ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his faceAnd Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven timesAnd one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burnAnd the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heiferThen the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the evenAnd he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the evenAnd a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sinAnd he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of Israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for everHe that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven daysHe shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be cleanWhosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the LORD and that soul shall be cut off from Israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon himThis is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven daysAnd every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is uncleanAnd whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven daysAnd for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vesselAnd a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a graveAnd the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at evenBut the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he is uncleanAnd it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until evenAnd whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until evenThen came the children of Israel even the whole congregation into the desert of Zin in the first month and the people abode in Kadesh and Miriam died there and was buried thereAnd there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against AaronAnd the people chode with Moses and spake saying Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORDAnd why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die thereAnd wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drinkAnd Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the LORD appeared unto themAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingTake the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drinkAnd Moses took the rod from before the LORD as he commanded himAnd Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them Hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rockAnd Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts alsoAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron Because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given themThis is the water of Meribah because the children of Israel strove with the LORD and he was sanctified in themAnd Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom Thus saith thy brother Israel Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen usHow our fathers went down into Egypt and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathersAnd when we cried unto the LORD he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of Egypt and behold we are in Kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy borderLet us pass I pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the kings highway we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy bordersAnd Edom said unto him Thou shalt not pass by me lest I come out against thee with the swordAnd the children of Israel said unto him We will go by the high way and if I and my cattle drink of thy water then I will pay for it I will only without doing any thing else go through on my feetAnd he said Thou shalt not go through And Edom came out against him with much people and with a strong handThus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border wherefore Israel turned away from himAnd the children of Israel even the whole congregation journeyed from Kadesh and came unto mount HorAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor by the coast of the land of Edom sayingAaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of MeribahTake Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount HorAnd strip Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die thereAnd Moses did as the LORD commanded and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregationAnd Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son and Aaron died there in the top of the mount and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountAnd when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead they mourned for Aaron thirty days even all the house of IsraelAnd when king Arad the Canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisonersAnd Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD and said If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then I will utterly destroy their citiesAnd the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place HormahAnd they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea to compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the wayAnd the people spake against God and against Moses Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light breadAnd the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel diedTherefore the people came to Moses and said We have sinned for we have spoken against the LORD and against thee pray unto the LORD that he take away the serpents from us And Moses prayed for the peopleAnd the LORD said unto Moses Make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall liveAnd Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he livedAnd the children of Israel set forward and pitched in ObothAnd they journeyed from Oboth and pitched at Ije-abarim in the wilderness which is before Moab toward the sunrisingFrom thence they removed and pitched in the valley of ZaredFrom thence they removed and pitched on the other side of Arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites for Arnon is the border of Moab between Moab and the AmoritesWherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD What he did in the Red sea and in the brooks of ArnonAnd at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar and lieth upon the border of MoabAnd from thence they went to Beer that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses Gather the people together and I will give them waterThen Israel sang this song Spring up O well sing ye unto itThe princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves And from the wilderness they went to MattanahAnd from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to BamothAnd from Bamoth in the valley that is in the country of Moab to the top of Pisgah which looketh toward JeshimonAnd Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites sayingLet me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the kings high way until we be past thy bordersAnd Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border but Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness and he came to Jahaz and fought against IsraelAnd Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok even unto the children of Ammon for the border of the children of Ammon was strongAnd Israel took all these cities and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereofFor Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto ArnonWherefore they that speak in proverbs say Come into Heshbon let the city of Sihon be built and preparedFor there is a fire gone out of Heshbon a flame from the city of Sihon it hath consumed Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places of ArnonWoe to thee Moab thou art undone O people of Chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto Sihon king of the AmoritesWe have shot at them Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah which reacheth unto MedebaThus Israel dwelt in the land of the AmoritesAnd Moses sent to spy out Jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the Amorites that were thereAnd they turned and went up by the way of Bashan and Og the king of Bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at EdreiAnd the LORD said unto Moses Fear him not for I have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at HeshbonSo they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his landAnd the children of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by JerichoAnd Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the AmoritesAnd Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and Moab was distressed because of the children of IsraelAnd Moab said unto the elders of Midian Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that timeHe sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying Behold there is a people come out from Egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against meCome now therefore I pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure I shall prevail that we may smite them and that I may drive them out of the land for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursedAnd the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto Balaam and spake unto him the words of BalakAnd he said unto them Lodge here this night and I will bring you word again as the LORD shall speak unto me and the princes of Moab abode with BalaamAnd God came unto Balaam and said What men are these with theeAnd Balaam said unto God Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab hath sent unto me sayingBehold there is a people come out of Egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them outAnd God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessedAnd Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Balak Get you into your land for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with youAnd the princes of Moab rose up and they went unto Balak and said Balaam refuseth to come with usAnd Balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than theyAnd they came to Balaam and said to him Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor Let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto meFor I will promote thee unto very great honour and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore I pray thee curse me this peopleAnd Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God to do less or moreNow therefore I pray you tarry ye also here this night that I may know what the LORD will say unto me moreAnd God came unto Balaam at night and said unto him If the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee that shalt thou doAnd Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of MoabAnd Gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him Now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with himAnd the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the wayBut the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that sideAnd when the ass saw the angel of the LORD she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed Balaams foot against the wall and he smote her againAnd the angel of the LORD went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the leftAnd when the ass saw the angel of the LORD she fell down under Balaam and Balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staffAnd the LORD opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto Balaam What have I done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three timesAnd Balaam said unto the ass Because thou hast mocked me I would there were a sword in mine hand for now would I kill theeAnd the ass said unto Balaam Am not I thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day was I ever wont to do so unto thee And he said NayThen the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his faceAnd the angel of the LORD said unto him Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold I went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before meAnd the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also I had slain thee and saved her aliveAnd Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD I have sinned for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee I will get me back againAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam Go with the men but only the word that I shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak So Balaam went with the princes of BalakAnd when Balak heard that Balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab which is in the border of Arnon which is in the utmost coastAnd Balak said unto Balaam Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am I not able indeed to promote thee to honourAnd Balaam said unto Balak Lo I am come unto thee have I now any power at all to say any thing the word that God putteth in my mouth that shall I speakAnd Balaam went with Balak and they came unto Kirjath-huzothAnd Balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to Balaam and to the princes that were with himAnd it came to pass on the morrow that Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the peopleAnd Balaam said unto Balak Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven ramsAnd Balak did as Balaam had spoken and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ramAnd Balaam said unto Balak Stand by thy burnt offering and I will go peradventure the LORD will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee And he went to an high placeAnd God met Balaam and he said unto him I have prepared seven altars and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ramAnd the LORD put a word in Balaams mouth and said Return unto Balak and thus thou shalt speakAnd he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of MoabAnd he took up his parable and said Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram out of the mountains of the east saying Come curse me Jacob and come defy IsraelHow shall I curse whom God hath not cursed or how shall I defy whom the LORD hath not defiedFor from the top of the rocks I see him and from the hills I behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nationsWho can count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel Let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like hisAnd Balak said unto Balaam What hast thou done unto me I took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogetherAnd he answered and said Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouthAnd Balak said unto him Come I pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thenceAnd he brought him into the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altarAnd he said unto Balak Stand here by thy burnt offering while I meet the LORD yonderAnd the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said Go again unto Balak and say thusAnd when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him And Balak said unto him What hath the LORD spokenAnd he took up his parable and said Rise up Balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of ZipporGod is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it goodBehold I have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse itHe hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel the LORD his God is with him and the shout of a king is among themGod brought them out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicornSurely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel What hath God wroughtBehold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slainAnd Balak said unto Balaam Neither curse them at all nor bless them at allBut Balaam answered and said unto Balak Told not I thee saying All that the LORD speaketh that I must doAnd Balak said unto Balaam Come I pray thee I will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thenceAnd Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor that looketh toward JeshimonAnd Balaam said unto Balak Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven ramsAnd Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altarAnd when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wildernessAnd Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of God came upon himAnd he took up his parable and said Balaam the son of Beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath saidHe hath said which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the Almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes openHow goodly are thy tents O Jacob and thy tabernacles O IsraelAs the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted and as cedar trees beside the watersHe shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than Agag and his kingdom shall be exaltedGod brought him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrowsHe couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up Blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth theeAnd Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam and he smote his hands together and Balak said unto Balaam I called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three timesTherefore now flee thou to thy place I thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the LORD hath kept thee back from honourAnd Balaam said unto Balak Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me sayingIf Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the LORD saith that will I speakAnd now behold I go unto my people come therefore and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter daysAnd he took up his parable and said Balaam the son of Beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath saidHe hath said which heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the most High which saw the vision of the Almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes openI shall see him but not now I shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a Star out of Jacob and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel and shall smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of ShethAnd Edom shall be a possession Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies and Israel shall do valiantlyOut of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the cityAnd when he looked on Amalek he took up his parable and said Amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that he perish for everAnd he looked on the Kenites and took up his parable and said Strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rockNevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted until Asshur shall carry thee away captiveAnd he took up his parable and said Alas who shall live when God doeth thisAnd ships shall come from the coast of Chittim and shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber and he also shall perish for everAnd Balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and Balak also went his wayAnd Israel abode in Shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of MoabAnd they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their godsAnd Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor and the anger of the LORD was kindled against IsraelAnd the LORD said unto Moses Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the LORD against the sun that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from IsraelAnd Moses said unto the judges of Israel Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peorAnd behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd when Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his handAnd he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly So the plague was stayed from the children of IsraelAnd those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousandAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingPhinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousyWherefore say Behold I give unto him my covenant of peaceAnd he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of IsraelNow the name of the Israelite that was slain even that was slain with the Midianitish woman was Zimri the son of Salu a prince of a chief house among the SimeonitesAnd the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur he was head over a people and of a chief house in MidianAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingVex the Midianites and smite themFor they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for Peors sakeAnd it came to pass after the plague that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest sayingTake the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward throughout their fathers house all that are able to go to war in IsraelAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab

and which may bring them in that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherdAnd the LORD said unto Moses Take thee Joshua the son of Nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon himAnd set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sightAnd thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedientAnd he shall stand before Eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD at his word shall they go out and at his

Israel according to all that the LORD commanded MosesAnd Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel saying This is the thing which the LORD hath commandedIf a man vow a vow unto the LORD or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouthIf a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD and bind herself by a bond being in her fathers house in her youthAnd her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall standBut if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the LORD shall forgive her because her father disallowed herAnd if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soulAnd her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall standBut if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the LORD shall forgive herBut every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against herAnd if she vowed in her husbands house or bound her soul by a bond with an oathAnd her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall standBut if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the LORD shall forgive herEvery vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it voidBut if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard themBut if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquityThese are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her fathers houseAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingAvenge the children of Israel of the Midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy peopleAnd Moses spake unto the people saying Arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the LORD of MidianOf every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of Israel shall ye send to the warSo there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for warAnd Moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his handAnd they warred against the Midianites as the LORD commanded Moses and they slew all the malesAnd they slew the kings of Midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba five kings of Midian Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the swordAnd the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goodsAnd they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fireAnd they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beastsAnd they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of Israel unto the camp at the plains of Moab which are by Jordan near JerichoAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the campAnd Moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battleAnd Moses said unto them Have ye saved all the women aliveBehold these caused the children of Israel through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORDNow therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with himBut all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselvesAnd do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh dayAnd purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of woodAnd Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded MosesOnly the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the leadEvery thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the waterAnd ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the campAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingTake the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregationAnd divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregationAnd levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheepTake it of their half and give it unto Eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the LORDAnd of the children of Israels half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the Levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORDAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded MosesAnd the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheepAnd threescore and twelve thousand beevesAnd threescore and one thousand assesAnd thirty and two thousand persons in all of woman that had not known man by lying with himAnd the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheepAnd the LORDs tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteenAnd the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the LORDs tribute was threescore and twelveAnd the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the LORDs tribute was threescore and oneAnd the persons were sixteen thousand of which the LORDs tribute was thirty and two personsAnd Moses gave the tribute which was the LORDs heave offering unto Eleazar the priest as the LORD commanded MosesAnd of the children of Israels half which Moses divided from the men that warredNow the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheepAnd thirty and six thousand beevesAnd thirty thousand asses and five hundredAnd sixteen thousand personsEven of the children of Israels half Moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the Levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD as the LORD commanded MosesAnd the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto MosesAnd they said unto Moses Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of usWe have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the LORDAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewelsAnd all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekelsFor the men of war had taken spoil every man for himselfAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORDNow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for cattleThe children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation sayingAtaroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Shebam and Nebo and BeonEven the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattleWherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over JordanAnd Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben Shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit hereAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given themThus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the landFor when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given themAnd the LORDs anger was kindled the same time and he sware sayingSurely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob because they have not wholly followed meSave Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite and Joshua the son of Nun for they have wholly followed the LORDAnd the LORDs anger was kindled against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumedAnd behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward IsraelFor if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this peopleAnd they came near unto him and said We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little onesBut we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the landWe will not return unto our houses until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritanceFor we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastwardAnd Moses said unto them If ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the LORD to warAnd will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD until he hath driven out his enemies from before himAnd the land be subdued before the LORD then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the LORD and before Israel and this land shall be your possession before the LORDBut if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the LORD and be sure your sin will find you outBuild you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouthAnd the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses saying Thy servants will do as my lord commandethOur little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of GileadBut thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the LORD to battle as my lord saithSo concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of IsraelAnd Moses said unto them If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan every man armed to battle before the LORD and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possessionBut if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of CanaanAnd the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered saying As the LORD hath said unto thy servants so will we doWe will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be oursAnd Moses gave unto them even to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan

first month on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the EgyptiansFor the Egyptians buried all their firstborn which the LORD had smitten among them upon their gods also the LORD executed judgmentsAnd the children of Israel removed from Rameses and pitched in SuccothAnd they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham which is in the

edge of the land of EdomAnd Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt in the first day of the fifth monthAnd Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount HorAnd king Arad the Canaanite which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan heard of

by Jordan from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of MoabAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and say unto them When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of CanaanThen ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high placesAnd ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess itAnd ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every mans inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inheritBut if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwellMoreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto themAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingCommand the children of Israel and say unto them When ye come into the land of Canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereofThen your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastwardAnd your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea and shall go on to Hazar-addar and pass on to AzmonAnd the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt and the goings out of it shall be at the seaAnd as for the western border ye shall even have the great sea for a border this shall be your west borderAnd this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount HorFrom mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath and the goings forth of the border shall be to ZedadAnd the border shall go on to Ziphron and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan this shall be your north borderAnd ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to ShephamAnd the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastwardAnd the border shall go down to Jordan and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round aboutAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel saying This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the half tribeFor the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritanceThe two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward toward the sunrisingAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingThese are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of NunAnd ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land by inheritanceAnd the names of the men are these Of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of JephunnehAnd of the tribe of the children of Simeon Shemuel the son of AmmihudOf the tribe of Benjamin Elidad the son of ChislonAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan Bukki the son of JogliThe prince of the children of Joseph for the tribe of the children of Manasseh Hanniel the son of EphodAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim Kemuel the son of ShiphtanAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun Elizaphan the son of ParnachAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar Paltiel the son of AzzanAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher Ahihud the son of ShelomiAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali Pedahel the son of AmmihudThese are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of CanaanAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho sayingCommand the children of Israel that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about themAnd the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beastsAnd the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round aboutAnd ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the suburbs of the citiesAnd among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty and two citiesSo all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbsAnd the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel from them that have many ye shall give many but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheritethAnd the LORD spake unto Moses sayingSpeak unto the children of Israel and say unto them When ye be come over Jordan into the land of CanaanThen ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at unawaresAnd they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgmentAnd of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refugeYe shall give three cities on this side Jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan which shall be cities of refugeThese six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thitherAnd if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to deathAnd if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to deathOr if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to deathThe revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him he shall slay himBut if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of wait that he dieOr in enmity smite him with his hand that he die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth himBut if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon him any thing without laying of waitOr with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he die and was not his enemy neither sought his harmThen the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgmentsAnd the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oilBut if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge whither he was fledAnd the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of bloodBecause he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possessionSo these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellingsWhoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to dieMoreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to deathAnd ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priestSo ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed itDefile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein I dwell for I the LORD dwell among the children of IsraelAnd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of the sons of Joseph came near and spake before Moses and before the princes the chief fathers of the children of IsraelAnd they said The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughtersAnd if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritanceAnd when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathersAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD saying The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said wellThis is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad saying Let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marrySo shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathersAnd every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathersNeither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritanceEven as the LORD commanded Moses so did the daughters of ZelophehadFor Mahlal Tirzah and Hoglah and Milcah and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married unto their fathers brothers sonsAnd they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their fatherThese are the commandments and the judgments which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near JerichoThese be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red sea between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and DizahabThere are eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barneaAnd it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that Moses spake unto the children of Israel according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto themAfter he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites which dwelt in Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan which dwelt at Astaroth in EdreiOn this side Jordan in the land of Moab began Moses to declare this law sayingThe LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb saying Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountTurn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea side to the land of the Canaanites and unto Lebanon unto the great river the river EuphratesBehold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after themAnd I spake unto you at that time saying I am not able to bear you myself aloneThe LORD your God hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitudeThe LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised youHow can I myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strifeTake you wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and I will make them rulers over youAnd ye answered me and said The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to doSo I took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribesAnd I charged your judges at that time saying Hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with himYe shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is Gods and the cause that is too hard for you bring it unto me and I will hear itAnd I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should doAnd when we departed from Horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites as the LORD our God commanded us and we came to Kadesh-barneaAnd I said unto you Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites which the LORD our God doth give unto usBehold the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouragedAnd ye came near unto me every one of you and said We will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall comeAnd the saying pleased me well and I took twelve men of you one of a tribeAnd they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of Eshcol and searched it outAnd they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give usNotwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your GodAnd ye murmured in your tents and said Because the LORD hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy usWhither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying The people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims thereThen I said unto you Dread not neither be afraid of themThe LORD your God which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyesAnd in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came into this placeYet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your GodWho went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and in a cloud by dayAnd the LORD heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware sayingSurely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I sware to give unto your fathersSave Caleb the son of Jephunneh he shall see it and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the LORDAlso the LORD was angry with me for your sakes saying Thou also shalt not go in thitherBut Joshua the son of Nun which standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit itMoreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will I give it and they shall possess itBut as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red seaThen ye answered and said unto me We have sinned against the LORD we will go up and fight according to all that the LORD our God commanded us And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready to go up into the hillAnd the LORD said unto me Say unto them Go not up neither fight for I am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemiesSo I spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD and went presumptuously up into the hillAnd the Amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in Seir even unto HormahAnd ye returned and wept before the LORD but the LORD would not hearken to your voice nor give ear unto youSo ye abode in Kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode thereThen we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea as the LORD spake unto me and we compassed mount Seir many daysAnd the LORD spake unto me sayingYe have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northwardAnd command thou the people saying Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau which dwell in Seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves thereforeMeddle not with them for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breadth because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possessionYe shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drinkFor the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothingAnd when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir through the way of the plain from Elath and from Ezion-gaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of MoabAnd the LORD said unto me Distress not the Moabites neither contend with them in battle for I will not give thee of their land for a possession because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possessionThe Emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the AnakimsWhich also were accounted giants as the Anakims but the Moabites call them EmimsThe Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime but the children of Esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as Israel did unto the land of his possession which the LORD gave unto themNow rise up said I and get you over the brook Zered And we went over the brook ZeredAnd the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea until we were come over the brook Zered was thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as the LORD sware unto themFor indeed the hand of the LORD was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumedSo it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the peopleThat the LORD spake unto me sayingThou art to pass over through Ar the coast of Moab this dayAnd when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possessionThat also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the Ammonites call them ZamzummimsA people great and many and tall as the Anakims but the LORD destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their steadAs he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir when he destroyed the Horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this dayAnd the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim even unto Azzah the Caphtorims which came forth out of Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their steadRise ye up take your journey and pass over the river Arnon behold I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battleThis day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of theeAnd I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace sayingLet me pass through thy land I will go along by the high way I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the leftThou shalt sell me meat for money that I may eat and give me water for money that I may drink only I will pass through on my feetAs the children of Esau which dwell in Seir and the Moabites which dwell in Ar did unto me until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth usBut Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this dayAnd the LORD said unto me Behold I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his landThen Sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at JahazAnd the LORD our God delivered him before us and we smote him and his sons and all his peopleAnd we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remainOnly the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we tookFrom Aroer which is by the brink of the river of Arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto Gilead there was not one city too strong for us the LORD our God delivered all unto usOnly unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not nor unto any place of the river Jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad usThen we turned and went up the way to Bashan and Og the king of Bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at EdreiAnd the LORD said unto me Fear him not for I will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at HeshbonSo the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remainingAnd we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of Argob the kingdom of Og in BashanAll these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars beside unwalled towns a great manyAnd we utterly destroyed them as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every cityBut all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselvesAnd we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan from the river of Arnon unto mount HermonWhich Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion and the Amorites call it ShenirAll the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei cities of the kingdom of Og in BashanFor only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a manAnd this land which we possessed at that time from Aroer which is by the river Arnon and half mount Gilead and the cities thereof gave I unto the Reubenites and to the GaditesAnd the rest of Gilead and all Bashan being the kingdom of Og gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh all the region of Argob with all Bashan which was called the land of giantsJair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi and called them after his own name Bashan-havoth-jair unto this dayAnd I gave Gilead unto MachirAnd unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley and the border even unto the river Jabbok which is the border of the children of AmmonThe plain also and Jordan and the coast thereof from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under Ashdoth-pisgah eastwardAnd I commanded you at that time saying The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel all that are meet for the warBut your wives and your little ones and your cattle for I know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which I have given youUntil the LORD have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which I have given youAnd I commanded Joshua at that time saying Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passestYe shall not fear them for the LORD your God he shall fight for youAnd I besought the LORD at that time sayingO Lord GOD thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand for what God is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy mightI pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond Jordan that goodly mountain and LebanonBut the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the LORD said unto me Let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matterGet thee up into the top of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this JordanBut charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt seeSo we abode in the valley over against Beth-peorNow therefore hearken O Israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth youYe shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command youYour eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor for all the men that followed Baal-peor the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among youBut ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this dayBehold I have taught you statutes and judgments even as the LORD my God commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess itKeep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding peopleFor what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him forAnd what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this dayOnly take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sonsSpecially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb when the LORD said unto me Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their childrenAnd ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darknessAnd the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voiceAnd he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stoneAnd the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess itTake ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fireLest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or femaleThe likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the airThe likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earthAnd lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heavenBut the LORD hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this dayFurthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and sware that I should not go over Jordan and that I should not go in unto that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritanceBut I must die in this land I must not go over Jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good landTake heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden theeFor the LORD thy God is a consuming fire even a jealous GodWhen thou shalt beget children and childrens children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God to provoke him to angerI call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyedAnd the LORD shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the LORD shall lead youAnd there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smellBut if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soulWhen thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the LORD thy God and shalt be obedient unto his voiceFor the LORD thy God is a merciful God he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto themFor ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that God created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like itDid ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and liveOr hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyesUnto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God there is none else beside himOut of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fireAnd because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of EgyptTo drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this dayKnow therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the LORD he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none elseThou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the LORD thy God giveth thee for everThen Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrisingThat the slayer might flee thither which should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might liveNamely Bezer in the wilderness in the plain country of the Reubenites and Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites and Golan in Bashan of the ManassitesAnd this is the law which Moses set before the children of IsraelThese are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which Moses spake unto the children of Israel after they came forth out of EgyptOn this side Jordan in the valley over against Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon whom Moses and the children of Israel smote after they were come forth out of EgyptAnd they possessed his land and the land of Og king of Bashan two kings of the Amorites which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrisingFrom Aroer which is by the bank of the river Arnon even unto mount Sion which is HermonAnd all the plain on this side Jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain under the springs of PisgahAnd Moses called all Israel and said unto them Hear O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep and do themThe LORD our God made a covenant with us in HorebThe LORD made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this dayThe LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fireI stood between the LORD and you at that time to shew you the work of the LORD for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount sayingI am the LORD thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondageThou shalt have none other gods before meThou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earthThou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate meAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandmentsThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vainKeep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the LORD thy God hath commanded theeSix days thou shalt labour and do all thy workBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thouAnd remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath dayHonour thy father and thy mother as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth theeThou shalt not killNeither shalt thou commit adulteryNeither shalt thou stealNeither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbourNeither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shalt thou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighboursThese words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more And he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto meAnd it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your eldersAnd ye said Behold the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he livethNow therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more then we shall dieFor who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and livedGo thou near and hear all that the LORD our God shall say and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do itAnd the LORD heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and the LORD said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spokenO that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for everGo say to them Get you into your tents againBut as for thee stand thou here by me and I will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess itYe shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the leftYe shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possessNow these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess itThat thou mightest fear the LORD thy God to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolongedHear therefore O Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honeyHear O Israel The LORD our God is one LORDAnd thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mightAnd these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heartAnd thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest upAnd thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyesAnd thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gatesAnd it shall be when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildedst notAnd houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and be fullThen beware lest thou forget the LORD which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondageThou shalt fear the LORD thy God and serve him and shalt swear by his nameYe shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about youFor the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earthYe shall not tempt the LORD your God as ye tempted him in MassahYe shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded theeAnd thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathersTo cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the LORD hath spokenAnd when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the LORD our God hath commanded youThen thou shalt say unto thy son We were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty handAnd the LORD shewed signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt upon Pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyesAnd he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathersAnd the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the LORD our God for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this dayAnd it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God as he hath commanded usWhen the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than thouAnd when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto themNeither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy sonFor they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenlyBut thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fireFor thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earthThe LORD did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all peopleBut because the LORD loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of Pharaoh king of EgyptKnow therefore that the LORD thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generationsAnd repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his faceThou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command thee this day to do themWherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathersAnd he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give theeThou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattleAnd the LORD will take away from thee all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate theeAnd thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto theeIf thou shalt say in thine heart These nations are more than I how can I dispossess themThou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh and unto all EgyptThe great temptations which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraidMoreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyedThou shalt not be affrighted at them for the LORD thy God is among you a mighty God and terribleAnd the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon theeBut the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyedAnd he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed themThe graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to the LORD thy GodNeither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thingAll the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathersAnd thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or noAnd he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man liveThy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty yearsThou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the LORD thy God chasteneth theeTherefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to fear himFor the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hillsA land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honeyA land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brassWhen thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given theeBeware that thou forget not the LORD thy God in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this dayLest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt thereinAnd when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multipliedThen thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the LORD thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondageWho led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flintWho fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter endAnd thou say in thine heart My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealthBut thou shalt remember the LORD thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this dayAnd it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perishAs the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your GodHear O Israel Thou art to pass over Jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fenced up to heavenA people great and tall the children of the Anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say Who can stand before the children of AnakUnderstand therefore this day that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly as the LORD hath said unto theeSpeak not thou in thine heart after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee saying For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before theeNot for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers Abraham Isaac and JacobUnderstand therefore that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked peopleRemember and forget not how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the LORDAlso in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed youWhen I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights I neither did eat bread nor drink waterAnd the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God and on them was written according to all the words which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assemblyAnd it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenantAnd the LORD said unto me Arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them they have made them a molten imageFurthermore the LORD spake unto me saying I have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked peopleLet me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than theySo I turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two handsAnd I looked and behold ye had sinned against the LORD your God and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded youAnd I took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyesAnd I fell down before the LORD as at the first forty days and forty nights I did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to angerFor I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time alsoAnd the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him and I prayed for Aaron also the same timeAnd I took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mountAnd at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah ye provoked the LORD to wrathLikewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea saying Go up and possess the land which I have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voiceYe have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew youThus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights as I fell down at the first because the LORD had said he would destroy youI prayed therefore unto the LORD and said O Lord GOD destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty handRemember thy servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sinLest the land whence thou broughtest us out say Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wildernessYet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out armAt that time the LORD said unto me Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of woodAnd I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the arkAnd I made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in mine handAnd he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the LORD gave them unto meAnd I turned myself and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which I had made and there they be as the LORD commanded meAnd the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera there Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his steadFrom thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jotbath a land of rivers of watersAt that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this dayWherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren the LORD is his inheritance according as the LORD thy God promised himAnd I stayed in the mount according to the first time forty days and forty nights and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also and the LORD would not destroy theeAnd the LORD said unto me Arise take thy journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which I sware unto their fathers to give unto themAnd now Israel what doth the LORD thy God require of thee but to fear the LORD thy God to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soulTo keep the commandments of the LORD and his statutes which I command thee this day for thy goodBehold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORDs thy God the earth also with all that therein isOnly the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this dayCircumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffneckedFor the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh rewardHe doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raimentLove ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of EgyptThou shalt fear the LORD thy God him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his nameHe is thy praise and he is thy God that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seenThy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitudeTherefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alwayAnd know ye this day for I speak not with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out armAnd his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt and unto all his landAnd what he did unto the army of Egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this dayAnd what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this placeAnd what he did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all IsraelBut your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he didTherefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess itAnd that ye may prolong your days in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honeyFor the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbsBut the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heavenA land which the LORD thy God careth for the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the yearAnd it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day to love the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soulThat I will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oilAnd I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be fullTake heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship themAnd then the LORDs wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth youTherefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyesAnd ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest upAnd thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gatesThat your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earthFor if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you to do them to love the LORD your God to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto himThen will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselvesEvery place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast beThere shall no man be able to stand before you for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto youBehold I set before you this day a blessing and a curseA blessing if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this dayAnd a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not knownAnd it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim and the curse upon mount EbalAre they not on the other side Jordan by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal beside the plains of MorehFor ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell thereinAnd ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this dayThese are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that ye live upon the earthYe shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green treeAnd ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that placeYe shall not do so unto the LORD your GodBut unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and thither thou shalt comeAnd thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocksAnd there ye shall eat before the LORD your God and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed theeYe shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyesFor ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth youBut when ye go over Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safetyThen there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORDAnd ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the Levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with youTake heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seestBut in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that I command theeNotwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hartOnly ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth as waterThou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of thine handBut thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the Levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands untoTake heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earthWhen the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee and thou shalt say I will eat flesh because thy soul longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul lusteth afterIf the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which the LORD hath given thee as I have commanded thee and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth afterEven as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alikeOnly be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the life and thou mayest not eat the life with the fleshThou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as waterThou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORDOnly thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which the LORD shall chooseAnd thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the LORD thy God and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God and thou shalt eat the fleshObserve and hear all these words which I command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy GodWhen the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their landTake heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before thee and that thou inquire not after their gods saying How did these nations serve their gods even so will I do likewiseThou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God for every abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done unto their gods for

gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying Let us go and serve other gods which ye have not knownThen shalt thou inquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among youThou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the swordAnd thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit for the LORD thy God and it shall be an heap for ever it shall not be built againAnd there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand that the LORD may turn from the fierceness

or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God in transgressing his covenantAnd hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which I have not commandedAnd it be told thee and thou hast heard of it and inquired diligently and behold it be true and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in IsraelThen shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman which have committed that wicked thing unto thy gates even that man or that woman and shalt stone them with stones till they dieAt the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to deathThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterward the hands of all the people So thou shalt put the evil away from among youIf there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment between blood and blood between plea and plea and between stroke and stroke being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall chooseAnd thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites and unto the judge that shall be in those days and inquire and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgmentAnd thou shalt do according to the sentence which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform theeAccording to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee to the right hand nor to the leftAnd the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put away the evil from IsraelAnd all the people shall hear and fear and do no more presumptuouslyWhen thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about meThou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the LORD thy God shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brotherBut he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you Ye shall henceforth return no more that wayNeither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and goldAnd it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the LevitesAnd it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the LORD his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do themThat his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of IsraelThe priests the Levites and all the tribe of Levi shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire and his inheritanceTherefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren the LORD is their inheritance as he hath said unto themAnd this shall be the priests due from the people from them that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the mawThe firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give himFor the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of the LORD him and his sons for everAnd if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall chooseThen he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God as all his brethren the Levites do which stand there before the LORDThey shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimonyWhen thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nationsThere shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witchOr a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancerFor all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before theeThou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy GodFor these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to doThe LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearkenAccording to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God neither let me see this great fire any more that I die notAnd the LORD said unto me They have well spoken that which they have spokenI will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command himAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of himBut the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall dieAnd if thou say in thine heart How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spokenWhen a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of himWhen the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their housesThou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess itThou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit into three parts that every slayer may flee thitherAnd this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time pastAs when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and liveLest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time pastWherefore I command thee saying Thou shalt separate three cities for theeAnd if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathersIf thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee beside these threeThat innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon theeBut if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these citiesThen the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may dieThine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with theeThou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess itOne witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be establishedIf a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrongThen both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the LORD before the priests and the judges which shall be in those daysAnd the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brotherThen shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among youAnd those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among youAnd thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for footWhen thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the LORD thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of EgyptAnd it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the peopleAnd shall say unto them Hear O Israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of themFor the LORD your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you agginst your enemies to save youAnd the officers shall speak unto the people saying What man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate itAnd what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of itAnd what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take herAnd the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heartAnd it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the peopleWhen thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto itAnd it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve theeAnd if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege itAnd when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the swordBut the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the LORD thy God hath given theeThus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nationsBut of the cities of these people which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breathethBut thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the Hittites and the Amorites the Canaanites and the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites as the LORD thy God hath commanded theeThat they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the LORD your GodWhen thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is mans life to employ them in the siegeOnly the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subduedIf one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath slain himThen thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slainAnd it shall be that the city which is next unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yokeAnd the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the heifers neck there in the valleyAnd the priests the sons of Levi shall come near for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the LORD and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be triedAnd all the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valleyAnd they shall answer and say Our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen itBe merciful O LORD unto thy people Israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israels charge And the blood shall be forgiven themSo shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORDWhen thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captiveAnd seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wifeThen thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nailsAnd she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wifeAnd it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled herIf a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hatedThen it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstbornBut he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is hisIf a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto themThen shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his placeAnd they shall say unto the elders of his city This our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkardAnd all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fearAnd if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a treeHis body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of God that thy land be not defiled which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritanceThou shalt not see the brothers ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brotherAnd if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him not then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it to him againIn like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do with his raiment and with all lost thing of thy brothers which he hath lost and thou hast found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest not hide thyselfThou shalt not see thy brothers ass or his ox fall down by the way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift them up againThe woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a womans garment for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy GodIf a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground whether they be young ones or eggs and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam with the youngBut thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy daysWhen thou buildest a new house then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man fall from thenceThou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be defiledThou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass togetherThou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts as of woollen and linen togetherThou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyselfIf any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate herAnd give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came to her I found her not a maidThen shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gateAnd the damsels father shall say unto the elders I gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth herAnd lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying I found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the cityAnd the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise himAnd they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his daysBut if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damselThen they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in Israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shalt thou put evil away from among youIf a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband then they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shalt thou put away evil from IsraelIf a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a man find her in the city and lie with herThen ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so thou shalt put away evil from among youBut if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall dieBut unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth him even so is this matterFor he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save herIf a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be foundThen the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled her he may not put her

her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wifeHer former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is

shalt stand abroad and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto theeAnd if the man be poor thou shalt not sleep with his pledgeIn any case thou shalt deliver him the

gate unto the elders and say My husbands brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel he will not perform the duty of my husbands brotherThen the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand to it and say I like not to take herThen shall his brothers wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brothers houseAnd his name shall be called in Israel The house of him that hath his shoe loosedWhen men

shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth theeFor all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an abomination unto the LORD thy GodRemember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of EgyptHow he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary and he feared not GodTherefore it shall be when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget itAnd it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance and possessest it and dwellest thereinThat thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name thereAnd thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days and say unto him I profess this day unto the LORD thy God that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give usAnd the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy GodAnd thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God A Syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into Egypt and sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty and populousAnd the Egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted us and laid upon us hard bondageAnd when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers the LORD heard our voice and looked on our affliction and our labour and our oppressionAnd the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and with wondersAnd he hath brought us into this place and hath given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honeyAnd now behold I have brought the firstfruits of the land which thou O LORD hast given me And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God and worship before the LORD thy GodAnd thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee and unto thine house thou and the Levite and the stranger that is among youWhen thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given it unto the Levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filledThen thou shalt say before the LORD thy God I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house and also have given them unto the Levite and unto the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me I have not transgressed thy commandments neither have I forgotten themI have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for the dead but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God and have done according to all that thou hast commanded meLook down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy people Israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honeyThis day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soulThou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and to hearken unto his voiceAnd the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandmentsAnd to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God as he hath spokenAnd Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people saying Keep all the commandments which I command you this dayAnd it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaister them with plaisterAnd thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised theeTherefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan that ye shall set up these stones which I command you this day in mount Ebal and thou shalt plaister them with plaisterAnd there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God an altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon themThou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy GodAnd thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and rejoice before the LORD thy GodAnd thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainlyAnd Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel saying Take heed and hearken O Israel this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy GodThou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God and do his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this dayAnd Moses charged the people the same day sayingThese shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people when ye are come over Jordan Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Joseph and BenjaminAnd these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse Reuben Gad and Asher and Zebulun Dan and NaphtaliAnd the Levites shall speak and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voiceCursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image an abomination unto the LORD the work of the hands of the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place And all the people shall answer and say AmenCursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that removeth his neighbours landmark And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger fatherless and widow And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife because he uncovereth his fathers skirt And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that lieth with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that lieth with his mother in law And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person And all the people shall say AmenCursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them And all the people shall say AmenAnd it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earthAnd all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy GodBlessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the fieldBlessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheepBlessed shall be thy basket and thy storeBlessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest outThe LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven waysThe LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all that thou settest thine hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth theeThe LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God and walk in his waysAnd all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD and they shall be afraid of theeAnd the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give theeThe LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrowAnd the LORD shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do themAnd thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve themBut it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake theeCursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the fieldCursed shall be thy basket and thy storeCursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheepCursed shalt thou be when thou comest in and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest outThe LORD shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of thy doings whereby thou hast forsaken meThe LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess itThe LORD shall smite thee with a consumption and with a fever and with an inflammation and with an extreme burning and with the sword and with blasting and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perishAnd thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be ironThe LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyedThe LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earthAnd thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air and unto the beasts of the earth and no man shall fray them awayThe LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healedThe LORD shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heartAnd thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore and no man shall save theeThou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shalt build an house and thou shalt not dwell therein thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not gather the grapes thereofThine ox shall be slain before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat thereof thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee thy sheep shall be given

there shall be no might in thine handThe fruit of thy land and all thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alwaySo that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt seeThe LORD shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy headThe LORD shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shalt thou serve other gods wood and stoneAnd thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all nations whither the LORD shall lead theeThou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but little in for the locust shall consume

not anoint thyself with the oil for thine olive shall cast his fruitThou shalt beget sons and daughters but thou shalt not enjoy them for they shall go into captivityAll thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consumeThe stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very lowHe shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tailMoreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded theeAnd they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for everBecause thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all thingsTherefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed theeThe LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understandA nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor shew favour to the youngAnd he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either corn wine or oil or the increase of thy kine or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed theeAnd he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the LORD thy God hath given theeAnd thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the LORD thy God hath given thee in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress theeSo that the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leaveSo that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gatesThe tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughterAnd toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gatesIf thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name THE LORD THY GODThen the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuanceMoreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto theeAlso every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the LORD bring upon thee until thou be destroyedAnd ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy GodAnd it shall come to pass that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess itAnd the LORD shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stoneAnd among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mindAnd thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have none assurance of thy lifeIn the morning thou shalt say Would God it were even and at even thou shalt say Would God it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt seeAnd the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships by the way whereof I spake unto thee Thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man shall buy youThese are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab beside the covenant which he made with them in HorebAnd Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his landThe great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miraclesYet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this dayAnd I have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy footYe have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that I am the LORD your GodAnd when ye came unto this place Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote themAnd we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half tribe of ManassehKeep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye doYe stand this day all of you before the LORD your God your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the men of IsraelYour little ones your wives and thy stranger that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy waterThat thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God and into his oath which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this dayThat he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a God as he hath said unto thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to JacobNeither with you only do I make this covenant and this oathBut with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God and also with him that is not here with us this dayFor ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the nations which ye passed byAnd ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among themLest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwoodAnd it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirstThe LORD will not spare him but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heavenAnd the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the lawSo that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon itAnd that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboim which the LORD overthrew in his anger and in his wrathEven all nations shall say Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great angerThen men shall say Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of EgyptFor they went and served other gods and worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given unto themAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this bookAnd the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this dayThe secret things belong unto the LORD our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this lawAnd it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the LORD thy God hath driven theeAnd shalt return unto the LORD thy God and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soulThat then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the LORD thy God hath scattered theeIf any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee and from thence will he fetch theeAnd the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathersAnd the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest liveAnd the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted theeAnd thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD and do all his commandments which I command thee this dayAnd the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathersIf thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soulFor this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far offIt is not in heaven that thou shouldest say Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do itNeither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do itBut the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do itSee I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evilIn that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess itBut if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve themI denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess itI call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may liveThat thou mayest love the LORD thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give themAnd Moses went and spake these words unto all IsraelAnd he said unto them I am an hundred and twenty years old this day I can no more go out and come in also the LORD hath said unto me Thou shalt not go over this JordanThe LORD thy God he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and Joshua he shall go over before thee as the LORD hath saidAnd the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og kings of the Amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyedAnd the LORD shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded youBe strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the LORD thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake theeAnd Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel Be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit itAnd the LORD he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayedAnd Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD and unto all the elders of IsraelAnd Moses commanded them saying At the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernaclesWhen all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearingGather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the LORD your God and observe to do all the words of this lawAnd that their children which have not known any thing may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess itAnd the LORD said unto Moses Behold thy days approach that thou must die call Joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that I may give him a charge And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregationAnd the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacleAnd the LORD said unto Moses Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with themThen my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and I will forsake them and I will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among usAnd I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other godsNow therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the children of Israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of IsraelFor when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenantAnd it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for I know their imagination which they go about even now before I have brought them into the land which I swareMoses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of IsraelAnd he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge and said Be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them and I will be with theeAnd it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finishedThat Moses commanded the Levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD sayingTake this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God that it may be there for a witness against theeFor I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while I am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the LORD and how much more after my deathGather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against themFor I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger through the work of your handsAnd Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were endedGive ear O ye heavens and I will speak and hear O earth the words of my mouthMy doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grassBecause I will publish the name of the LORD ascribe ye greatness unto our GodHe is the Rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a God of truth and without iniquity just and right is heThey have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generationDo ye thus requite the LORD O foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and established theeRemember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy elders and they will tell theeWhen the most High divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of IsraelFor the LORDs portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritanceHe found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eyeAs an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wingsSo the LORD alone did lead him and there was no strange god with himHe made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rockButter of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grapeBut Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook God which made him and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvationThey provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations provoked they him to angerThey sacrificed unto devils not to God to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared notOf the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten God that formed theeAnd when the LORD saw it he abhorred them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughtersAnd he said I will hide my face from them I will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faithThey have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nationFor a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountainsI will heap mischiefs upon them I will spend mine arrows upon themThey shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dustThe sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray hairsI said I would scatter them into corners I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among menWere it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely and lest they should say Our hand is high and the LORD hath not done all thisFor they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in themO that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter endHow should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their Rock had sold them and the LORD had shut them upFor their rock is not as our Rock even our enemies themselves being judgesFor their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitterTheir wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of aspsIs not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasuresTo me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make hasteFor the LORD shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or leftAnd he shall say Where are their gods their rock in whom they trustedWhich did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and be your protectionSee now that I even I am he and there is no god with me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my handFor I lift up my hand to heaven and say I live for everIf I whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on judgment I will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward them that hate meI will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemyRejoice O ye nations with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful unto his land and to his peopleAnd Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and Hoshea the son of NunAnd Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all IsraelAnd he said unto them Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this lawFor it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess itAnd the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day sayingGet thee up into this mountain Abarim unto mount Nebo which is in the land of Moab that is over against Jericho and behold the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel for a possessionAnd die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor and was gathered unto his peopleBecause ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of IsraelYet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of IsraelAnd this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his deathAnd he said The LORD came from Sinai and rose up from Seir unto them he shined forth from mount Paran and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for themYea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy wordsMoses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of JacobAnd he was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered togetherLet Reuben live and not die and let not his men be fewAnd this is the blessing of Judah and he said Hear LORD the voice of Judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemiesAnd of Levi he said Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at Massah and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of MeribahWho said unto his father and to his mother I have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word and kept thy covenantThey shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altarBless LORD his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not againAnd of Benjamin he said The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him and the LORD shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shouldersAnd of Joseph he said Blessed of the LORD be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneathAnd for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the moonAnd for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hillsAnd for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethrenHis glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim and they are the thousands of ManassehAnd of Zebulun he said Rejoice Zebulun in thy going out and Issachar in thy tentsThey shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sandAnd of Gad he said Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the headAnd he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the LORD and his judgments with IsraelAnd of Dan he said Dan is a lions whelp he shall leap from BashanAnd of Naphtali he said O Naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the LORD possess thou the west and the southAnd of Asher he said Let Asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oilThy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength beThere is none like unto the God of Jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the skyThe eternal God is thy refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say Destroy themIsrael then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop down dewHappy art thou O Israel who is like unto thee O people saved by the LORD the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high placesAnd Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo to the top of Pisgah that is over against Jericho And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead unto DanAnd all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah unto the utmost seaAnd the south and the plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees unto ZoarAnd the LORD said unto him This is the land which I sware unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob saying I will give it unto thy seed I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thitherSo Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the LORDAnd he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this dayAnd Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abatedAnd the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were endedAnd Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the LORD commanded MosesAnd there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the LORD knew face to faceIn all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his landAnd in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all IsraelNow after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun Moses minister sayingMoses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of IsraelEvery place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto MosesFrom the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coastThere shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake theeBe strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I sware unto their fathers to give themOnly be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goestThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good successHave not I commanded thee Be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goestThen Joshua commanded the officers of the people sayingPass through the host and command the people saying Prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess itAnd to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spake Joshua sayingRemember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you saying The LORD your God hath given you rest and hath given you this landYour wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help themUntil the LORD have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which Moses the LORDs servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrisingAnd they answered Joshua saying All that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will goAccording as we hearkened unto Moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the LORD thy God be with thee as he was with MosesWhosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courageAnd Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly saying Go view the land even Jericho And they went and came into an harlots house named Rahab and lodged thereAnd it was told the king of Jericho saying Behold there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the countryAnd the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying Bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the countryAnd the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus There came men unto me but I wist not whence they wereAnd it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went I wot not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake themBut she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roofAnd the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gateAnd before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roofAnd she said unto the men I know that the LORD hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of youFor we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you when ye came out of Egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Jordan Sihon and Og whom ye utterly destroyedAnd as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the LORD your God he is God in heaven above and in earth beneathNow therefore I pray you swear unto me by the LORD since I have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my fathers house and give me a true tokenAnd that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from deathAnd the men answered her Our life for yours if ye utter not this our business And it shall be when the LORD hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with theeThen she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wallAnd she said unto them Get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your wayAnd the men said unto her We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swearBehold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy fathers household home unto theeAnd it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon himAnd if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swearAnd she said According unto your words so be it And she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the windowAnd they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them notSo the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all things that befell themAnd they said unto Joshua Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of usAnd Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from Shittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed overAnd it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the hostAnd they commanded the people saying When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after itYet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretoforeAnd Joshua said unto the people Sanctify yourselves for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among youAnd Joshua spake unto the priests saying Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the peopleAnd the LORD said unto Joshua This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with theeAnd thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan ye shall stand still in JordanAnd Joshua said unto the children of Israel Come hither and hear the words of the LORD your GodAnd Joshua said Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the JebusitesBehold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into JordanNow therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel out of every tribe a manAnd it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an heapAnd it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the peopleAnd as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvestThat the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam that is beside Zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against JerichoAnd the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over JordanAnd it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over Jordan that the LORD spake unto Joshua sayingTake you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe a manAnd command ye them saying Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this nightThen Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a manAnd Joshua said unto them Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of IsraelThat this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying What mean ye by these stonesThen ye shall answer them That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD when it passed over Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for everAnd the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan as the LORD spake unto Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down thereAnd Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this dayFor the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the people hasted and passed overAnd it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the LORD passed over and the priests in the presence of the peopleAnd the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the children of Israel as Moses spake unto themAbout forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle to the plains of JerichoOn that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they feared him as they feared Moses all the days of his lifeAnd the LORD spake unto Joshua sayingCommand the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of JordanJoshua therefore commanded the priests saying Come ye up out of JordanAnd it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did beforeAnd the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in Gilgal in the east border of JerichoAnd those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua pitch in GilgalAnd he spake unto the children of Israel saying When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying What mean these stonesThen ye shall let your children know saying Israel came over this Jordan on dry landFor the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the LORD your God did to the Red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone overThat all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty that ye might fear the LORD your God for everAnd it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites which were on the side of Jordan westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the sea heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of IsraelAt that time the LORD said unto Joshua Make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second timeAnd Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskinsAnd this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise All the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of EgyptNow all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcisedFor the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honeyAnd their children whom he raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the wayAnd it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were wholeAnd the LORD said unto Joshua This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this dayAnd the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of JerichoAnd they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame dayAnd the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that yearAnd it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him Art thou for us or for our adversariesAnd he said Nay but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him What saith my lord unto his servantAnd the captain of the LORDs host said unto Joshua Loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy And Joshua did soNow Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came inAnd the LORD said unto Joshua See I have given into thine hand Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valourAnd ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once Thus shalt thou do six daysAnd seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpetsAnd it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before himAnd Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the LORDAnd he said unto the people Pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORDAnd it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the LORD and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed themAnd the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpetsAnd Joshua had commanded the people saying Ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then shall ye shoutSo the ark of the LORD compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the campAnd Joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORDAnd seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD the priests going on and blowing with the trumpetsAnd the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six daysAnd it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven timesAnd it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets Joshua said unto the people Shout for the LORD hath given you the cityAnd the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the LORD only Rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sentAnd ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble itBut all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the LORD they shall come into the treasury of the LORDSo the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the cityAnd they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the swordBut Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country Go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto herAnd the young men that were spies went in and brought Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of IsraelAnd they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the LORDAnd Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive and her fathers household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out JerichoAnd Joshua adjured them at that time saying Cursed be the man before the LORD that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of itSo the LORD was with Joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the countryBut the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of IsraelAnd Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is beside Beth-aven on the east side of Bethel and spake unto them saying Go up and view the country And the men went up and viewed AiAnd they returned to Joshua and said unto him Let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but fewSo there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of AiAnd the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as waterAnd Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide he and the elders of Israel and put dust upon their headsAnd Joshua said Alas O Lord GOD wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side JordanO Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemiesFor the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great nameAnd the LORD said unto Joshua Get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy faceIsrael hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuffTherefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among youUp sanctify the people and say Sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the LORD God of Israel There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee O Israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among youIn the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by manAnd it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he hath wrought folly in IsraelSo Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes and the tribe of Judah was takenAnd he brought the family of Judah and he took the family of the Zarhites and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man and Zabdi was takenAnd he brought his household man by man and Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was takenAnd Joshua said unto Achan My son give I pray thee glory to the LORD God of Israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from meAnd Achan answered Joshua and said Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel and thus and thus have I doneWhen I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then I coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under itSo Joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under itAnd they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the children of Israel and laid them out before the LORDAnd Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of AchorAnd Joshua said Why hast thou troubled us the LORD shall trouble thee this day And all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stonesAnd they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger Wherefore the name of that place was called The valley of Achor unto this dayAnd the LORD said unto Joshua Fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to Ai see I have given into thy hand the king of Ai and his people and his city and his landAnd thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind itSo Joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against Ai and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by nightAnd he commanded them saying Behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all readyAnd I and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before themFor they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say They flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before themThen ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the LORD your God will deliver it into your handAnd it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do See I have commanded youJoshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush and abode between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai but Joshua lodged that night among the peopleAnd Joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of Israel before the people to AiAnd all the people even the people of war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the north side of Ai now there was a valley between them and AiAnd he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai on the west side of the cityAnd when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city Joshua went that night into the midst of the valleyAnd it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the cityAnd Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wildernessAnd all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after Joshua and were drawn away from the cityAnd there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel that went not out after Israel and they left the city open and pursued after IsraelAnd the LORD said unto Joshua Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai for I will give it into thine hand And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the cityAnd the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fireAnd when the men of Ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuersAnd when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of AiAnd the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of Israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escapeAnd the king of Ai they took alive and brought him to JoshuaAnd it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the Israelites returned unto Ai and smote it with the edge of the swordAnd so it was that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of AiFor Joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AiOnly the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded JoshuaAnd Joshua burnt Ai and made it an heap for ever even a desolation unto this dayAnd the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this dayThen Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount EbalAs Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD and sacrificed peace offeringsAnd he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of IsraelAnd all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount Gerizim and half of them over against mount Ebal as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before that they should bless the people of IsraelAnd afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the lawThere was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among themAnd it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side Jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon the Hittite and the Amorite the Canaanite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite heard thereofThat they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one accordAnd when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to AiThey did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound upAnd old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldyAnd they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal and said unto him and to the men of Israel We be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with usAnd the men of Israel said unto the Hivites Peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with youAnd they said unto Joshua We are thy servants And Joshua said unto them Who are ye and from whence come yeAnd they said unto him From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in EgyptAnd all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan which was at AshtarothWherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying Take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them We are your servants therefore now make ye a league with usThis our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldyAnd these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journeyAnd the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORDAnd Joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto themAnd it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among themAnd the children of Israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kirjath-jearimAnd the children of Israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel And all the congregation murmured against the princesBut all the princes said unto all the congregation We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel now therefore we may not touch themThis we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto themAnd the princes said unto them Let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised themAnd Joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying Wherefore have ye beguiled us saying We are very far from you when ye dwell among usNow therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my GodAnd they answered Joshua and said Because it was certainly told thy servants how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thingAnd now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us doAnd so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel that they slew them notAnd Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD even unto this day in the place which he should chooseNow it came to pass when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and her king so he had done to Ai and her king and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among themThat they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than Ai and all the men thereof were mightyWherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron and unto Piram king of Jarmuth and unto Japhia king of Lachish and unto Debir king of Eglon sayingCome up unto me and help me that we may smite Gibeon for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of IsraelTherefore the five kings of the Amorites the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish the king of Eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before Gibeon and made war against itAnd the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal saying Slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against usSo Joshua ascended from Gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valourAnd the LORD said unto Joshua Fear them not for I have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before theeJoshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from Gilgal all nightAnd the LORD discomfited them before Israel and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon and smote them to Azekah and unto MakkedahAnd it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to Beth-horon that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the swordThen spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Sun stand thou still upon Gibeon and thou Moon in the valley of AjalonAnd the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies Is not this written in the book of Jasher So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole dayAnd there was no day like that before it or after it that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man for the LORD fought for IsraelAnd Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to GilgalBut these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at MakkedahAnd it was told Joshua saying The five kings are found hid in a cave at MakkedahAnd Joshua said Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep themAnd stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your handAnd it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced citiesAnd all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of IsraelThen said Joshua Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the caveAnd they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of EglonAnd it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him Come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings And they came near and put their feet upon the necks of themAnd Joshua said unto them Fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fightAnd afterward Joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the eveningAnd it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the caves mouth which remain until this very dayAnd that day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of JerichoThen Joshua passed from Makkedah and all Israel with him unto Libnah and fought against LibnahAnd the LORD delivered it also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of JerichoAnd Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him unto Lachish and encamped against it and fought against itAnd the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel which took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein according to all that he had done to LibnahThen Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remainingAnd from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon and all Israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against itAnd they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to LachishAnd Joshua went up from Eglon and all Israel with him unto Hebron and they fought against itAnd they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining according to all that he had done to Eglon but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that were thereinAnd Joshua returned and all Israel with him to Debir and fought against itAnd he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none remaining as he had done to Hebron so he did to Debir and to the king thereof as he had done also to Libnah and to her kingSo Joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the LORD God of Israel commandedAnd Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza and all the country of Goshen even unto GibeonAnd all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time because the LORD God of Israel fought for IsraelAnd Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to GilgalAnd it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of AchshaphAnd to the kings that were on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of Chinneroth and in the valley and in the borders of Dor on the westAnd to the Canaanite on the east and on the west and to the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the mountains and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of MizpehAnd they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with horses and chariots very manyAnd when all these kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom to fight against IsraelAnd the LORD said unto Joshua Be not afraid because of them for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fireSo Joshua came and all the people of war with him against them by the waters of Merom suddenly and they fell upon themAnd the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel who smote them and chased them unto great Zidon and unto Misrephoth-maim and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they left them none remainingAnd Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him he houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fireAnd Joshua at that time turned back and took Hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdomsAnd they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe and he burnt Hazor with fireAnd all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them did Joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he utterly destroyed them as Moses the servant of the LORD commandedBut as for the cities that stood still in their strength Israel burned none of them save Hazor only that did Joshua burnAnd all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither left they any to breatheAs the LORD commanded Moses his servant so did Moses command Joshua and so did Joshua he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded MosesSo Joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of Goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of Israel and the valley of the sameEven from the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew themJoshua made war a long time with all those kingsThere was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon all other they took in battleFor it was of the LORD to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the LORD commanded MosesAnd at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains from Hebron from Debir from Anab and from all the mountains of Judah and from all the mountains of Israel Joshua destroyed them utterly with their citiesThere was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel only in Gaza in Gath and in Ashdod there remainedSo Joshua took the whole land according to all that the LORD said unto Moses and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes And the land rested from warNow these are the kings of the land which the children of Israel smote and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon and all the plain on the eastSihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer which is upon the bank of the river Arnon and from the middle of the river and from half Gilead even unto the river Jabbok which is the border of the children of AmmonAnd from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east and unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to Beth-jeshimoth and from the south under Ashdoth-pisgahAnd the coast of Og king of Bashan which was of the remnant of the giants that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at EdreiAnd reigned in mount Hermon and in Salcah and in all Bashan unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites and half Gilead the border of Sihon king of HeshbonThem did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of ManassehAnd these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisionsIn the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country the Hittites the Amorites and the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the JebusitesThe king

Megiddo oneThe king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam of Carmel oneThe king of Dor in the coast of Dor one the king of the nations of Gilgal oneThe king of Tirzah one all the kings thirty and oneNow Joshua was old and stricken in years and the LORD said unto him Thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessedThis is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the Philistines and all GeshuriFrom Sihor which is before Egypt even unto the borders of Ekron northward which is counted to the Canaanite five lords of the Philistines the Gazathites and the Ashdothites the Eshkalonites the Gittites and the Ekronites also the AvitesFrom the south all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek to the borders of the AmoritesAnd the land of the Giblites and all Lebanon toward the sunrising from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into HamathAll the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim and all the Sidonians them will I drive out from before the children of Israel only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance as I have commanded theeNow therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of ManassehWith whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond Jordan eastward even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave themFrom Aroer that is upon the bank of the river Arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of Medeba unto DibonAnd all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites which reigned in Heshbon unto the border of the children of AmmonAnd Gilead and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites and all mount Hermon and all Bashan unto SalcahAll the kingdom of Og in Bashan which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did Moses smite and cast them outNevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites nor the Maachathites but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this dayOnly unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance as he said unto themAnd Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their familiesAnd their coast was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain by MedebaHeshbon and all her cities that are in the plain Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meonAnd Jahazah and Kedemoth and MephaathAnd Kirjathaim and Sibmah and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valleyAnd Beth-peor and Ashdoth-pisgah and Beth-jeshimothAnd all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites which reigned in Heshbon whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba which were dukes of Sihon dwelling in the countryBalaam also the son of Beor the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by themAnd the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan and the border thereof This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families the cities and the villages thereofAnd Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad even unto the children of Gad according to their familiesAnd their coast was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead and half the land of the children of Ammon unto Aroer that is before RabbahAnd from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim and from Mahanaim unto the border of DebirAnd in the valley Beth-aram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon Jordan and his border even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastwardThis is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families the cities and their villagesAnd Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their familiesAnd their coast was from Mahanaim all Bashan all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan threescore citiesAnd half Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh even to the one half of the children of Machir by their familiesThese are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastwardBut unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance as he said unto themAnd these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to themBy lot was their inheritance as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribeFor Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among themFor the children of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land save cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substanceAs the LORD commanded Moses so the children of Israel did and they divided the landThen the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barneaForty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in mine heartNevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the LORD my GodAnd Moses sware on that day saying Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens for ever because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my GodAnd now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day fourscore and five years oldAs yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come inNow therefore give me this mountain whereof the LORD spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the LORD will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the LORD saidAnd Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritanceHebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day because that he wholly followed the LORD God of IsraelAnd the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba which Arba was a great man among the Anakims And the land had rest from warThis then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coastAnd their south border was from the shore of the salt sea from the bay that looketh southwardAnd it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim and passed along to Zin and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea and passed along to Hezron and went up to Adar and fetched a compass to KarkaaFrom thence it passed toward Azmon and went out unto the river of Egypt and the goings out of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coastAnd the east border was the salt sea even unto the end of Jordan And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of JordanAnd the border went up to Beth-hogla and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of ReubenAnd the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor and so northward looking toward Gilgal that is before the going up to Adummim which is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh and the goings out thereof were at En-rogelAnd the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite the same is Jerusalem and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward which is at the end of the valley of the giants northwardAnd the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah and went out to the cities of mount Ephron and the border was drawn to Baalah which is Kirjath-jearimAnd the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim which is Chesalon on the north side and went down to Beth-shemesh and passed on to TimnahAnd the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward and the border was drawn to Shicron and passed along to mount Baalah and went out unto Jabneel and the goings out of the border were at the seaAnd the west border was to the great sea and the coast thereof This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their familiesAnd unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua even the city of Arba the father of Anak which city is HebronAnd Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai the children of AnakAnd he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepherAnd Caleb said He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher and taketh it to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wifeAnd Othniel the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wifeAnd it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass and Caleb said unto her What wouldest thouWho answered Give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springsThis is

along unto the borders of Archi to AtarothAnd goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether and to Gezer and the goings out thereof are at the seaSo the children of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim took their inheritanceAnd the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar unto Beth-horon the upperAnd the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh and passed by it on the east to JanohahAnd it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and to Naarath and came to Jericho and went out at JordanThe border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their familiesAnd the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh all the cities with their villagesAnd they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day and serve under tributeThere was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh for he was the firstborn of Joseph to wit for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh the father of Gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had Gilead and BashanThere was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families for the children of Abiezer and for the children of Helek and for the children of Asriel and for the children of Shechem and for the children of Hepher and for the children of Shemida these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their familiesBut Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters Mahlah and Noah Hoglah Milcah and TirzahAnd they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the princes saying The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their fatherAnd there fell ten portions to Manasseh beside the land of Gilead and Bashan which were on the other side JordanBecause the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the rest of Manassehs sons had the land of GileadAnd the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah that lieth before Shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuahNow Manasseh had the land of Tappuah but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of EphraimAnd the coast descended unto the river Kanah southward of the river these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were at the seaSouthward it was Ephraims and northward it was Manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in Asher on the north and in Issachar on the eastAnd Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns and Ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns even three countriesYet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the Canaanites would dwell in that landYet it came to pass when the children of Israel were waxen strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them outAnd the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua saying Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing I am a great people forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hithertoAnd Joshua answered them If thou be a great people then get thee up to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants if mount Ephraim be too narrow for theeAnd the children of Joseph said The hill is not enough for us and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns and they who are of the valley of JezreelAnd Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph even to Ephraim and to Manasseh saying Thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot onlyBut the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strongAnd the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there And the land was subdued before themAnd there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritanceAnd Joshua said unto the children of Israel How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers hath given youGive out from among you three men for each tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to meAnd they shall divide it into seven parts Judah shall abide in their coast on the south and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the northYe shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our GodBut the Levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance and Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east which Moses the servant of the LORD gave themAnd the men arose and went away and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying Go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in ShilohAnd the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again to Joshua to the host at ShilohAnd

may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of bloodAnd when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among themAnd if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbour unwittingly and hated him not beforetimeAnd he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fledAnd they appointed Kedesh

these citiesAnd the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt thereinAnd the LORD gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the LORD delivered all their enemies into their handThere failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel all came to passThen Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of ManassehAnd said unto them Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded youYe have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your GodAnd now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side JordanBut take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you to love the LORD your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soulSo Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tentsNow to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed themAnd he spake unto them saying Return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethrenAnd the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan to go unto the country of Gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the word of the LORD by the hand of MosesAnd when they came unto the borders of Jordan that are in the land of Canaan the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan a great altar to see toAnd the children of Israel heard say Behold the chidren of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of Jordan at the passage of the children of IsraelAnd when the children of Israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh to go up to war against themAnd the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priestAnd with him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of IsraelAnd they came unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh unto the land of Gilead and they spake with them sayingThus saith the whole congregation of the LORD What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the LORD in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the LORDIs the iniquity of Peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORDBut that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of IsraelNotwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD wherein the LORDs tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the LORD nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our GodDid not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquityThen the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of IsraelThe LORD God of gods the LORD God of gods he knoweth and Israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the LORD save us not this dayThat we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the LORD himself require itAnd if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying In time to come your children might speak unto our children saying What have ye to do with the LORD God of IsraelFor the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you ye children of Reuben and children of Gad ye have no part in the LORD so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORDTherefore we said Let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrificeBut that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come Ye have no part in the LORDTherefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and youGod forbid that we should rebel against the LORD and turn this day from following the LORD to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacleAnd when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake it pleased themAnd Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the children of Manasseh This day we perceive that the LORD is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORDAnd Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of Reuben and from the children of Gad out of the land of Gilead unto the land of Canaan to the children of Israel and brought them word againAnd the thing pleased the children of Israel and the children of Israel blessed God and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dweltAnd the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is GodAnd it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua waxed old and stricken in ageAnd Joshua called for all Israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them I am old and stricken in ageAnd ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for youBehold I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the nations that I have cut off even unto the great sea westwardAnd the LORD your God he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the LORD your God hath promised unto youBe ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the leftThat ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto themBut cleave unto the LORD your God as ye have done unto this dayFor the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto this dayOne man of you shall chase a thousand for the LORD your God he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised youTake good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the LORD your GodElse if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to youKnow for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given youAnd behold this day I am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath failed thereofTherefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the LORD your God promised you so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given youWhen ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto youAnd Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before GodAnd Joshua said unto all the people Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nachor and they served other godsAnd I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of Canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him IsaacAnd I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Esau mount Seir to possess it but Jacob and his children went down into EgyptI sent Moses also and Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to that which I did among them and afterward I brought you outAnd I brought your fathers out of Egypt and ye came unto the sea and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red seaAnd when they cried unto the LORD he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long seasonAnd I brought you into the land of the Amorites which dwelt on the other side Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and I destroyed them from before youThen Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab arose and warred against Israel and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse youBut I would not hearken unto Balaam therefore he blessed you still so I delivered you out of his handAnd ye went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of Jericho fought against you the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Girgashites the Hivites and the Jebusites and I delivered them into your handAnd I sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the Amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bowAnd I have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eatNow therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the LORDAnd if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the LORDAnd the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the LORD to serve other godsFor the LORD our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passedAnd the LORD drave out from before us all the people even the Amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the LORD for he is our GodAnd Joshua said unto the people Ye cannot serve the LORD for he is an holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sinsIf ye forsake the LORD and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you goodAnd the people said unto Joshua Nay but we will serve the LORDAnd Joshua said unto the people Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD to serve him And they said We are witnessesNow therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the LORD God of IsraelAnd the people said unto Joshua The LORD our God will we serve and his voice will we obeySo Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in ShechemAnd Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORDAnd Joshua said unto all the people Behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your GodSo Joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritanceAnd it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died being an hundred and ten years oldAnd they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah which is in mount Ephraim on the north side of the hill of GaashAnd Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua and which had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for IsraelAnd the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt buried they in Shechem in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of JosephAnd Eleazar the son of Aaron died and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son which was given him in mount EphraimNow after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the LORD saying Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against themAnd the LORD said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land into his handAnd Judah said unto Simeon his brother Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanites and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot So Simeon went with himAnd Judah went up and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand menAnd they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and they fought against him and they slew the Canaanites and the PerizzitesBut Adoni-bezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toesAnd Adoni-bezek said Threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as I have done so God hath requited me And they brought him to Jerusalem and there he diedNow the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fireAnd afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valleyAnd Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and TalmaiAnd from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepherAnd Caleb said He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher and taketh it to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wifeAnd Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother took it and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wifeAnd it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and Caleb said unto her What wilt thouAnd she said unto him Give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springsAnd the children of the Kenite Moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah which lieth in the south of Arad and they went and dwelt among the peopleAnd Judah went with Simeon his brother and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it And the name of the city was called HormahAlso Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof and Askelon with the coast thereof and Ekron with the coast thereofAnd the LORD was with Judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of ironAnd they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of AnakAnd the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this dayAnd the house of Joseph they also went up against Bethel and the LORD was with themAnd the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel Now the name of the city before was LuzAnd the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him Shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercyAnd when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his familyAnd the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name thereof Luz which is the name thereof unto this dayNeither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns nor Taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that landAnd it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them outNeither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among themNeither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron nor the inhabitants of Nahalol but the Canaanites dwelt among them and became tributariesNeither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho nor the inhabitants of Zidon nor of Ahlab nor of Achzib nor of Helbah nor of Aphik nor of RehobBut the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them outNeither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath but he dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto themAnd the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valleyBut the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed so that they became tributariesAnd the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim from the rock and upwardAnd an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers and I said I will never break my covenant with youAnd ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done thisWherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto youAnd it came to pass when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel that the people lifted up their voice and weptAnd they called the name of that place Bochim and they sacrificed there unto the LORDAnd when Joshua had let the people go the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the landAnd the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the LORD that he did for IsraelAnd Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died being an hundred and ten years oldAnd they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the mount of Ephraim on the north side of the hill GaashAnd also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the LORD nor yet the works which he had done for IsraelAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served BaalimAnd they forsook the LORD God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD to angerAnd they forsook the LORD and served Baal and AshtarothAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemiesWhithersoever they went out the hand of the LORD was against them for evil as the LORD had said and as the LORD had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressedNevertheless the LORD raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled themAnd yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD but they did not soAnd when the LORD raised them up judges then the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed themAnd it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn wayAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he said Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voiceI also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he diedThat through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or notTherefore the LORD left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of JoshuaNow these are the nations which the LORD left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of CanaanOnly that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereofNamely five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of HamathAnd they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD which he commanded their fathers by the hand of MosesAnd the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and JebusitesAnd they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their godsAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and forgat the LORD their God and served Baalim and the grovesTherefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight yearsAnd when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them even Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs younger brotherAnd the Spirit of the LORD came upon him and he judged Israel and went out to war and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaimAnd the land had rest forty years And Othniel the son of Kenaz diedAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORDAnd he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel and possessed the city of palm treesSo the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen yearsBut when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD the LORD raised them up a deliverer Ehud the son of Gera a Benjamite a man lefthanded and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of MoabBut Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thighAnd he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab and Eglon was a very fat manAnd when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bare the presentBut he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal and said I have a secret errand unto thee O king who said Keep silence And all that stood by him went out from himAnd Ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour which he had for himself alone And Ehud said I have a message from God unto thee And he arose out of his seatAnd Ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his bellyAnd the haft also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came outThen Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked themWhen he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamberAnd they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earthAnd Ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto SeirathAnd it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount and he before themAnd he said unto them Follow after me for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand And they went down after him and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab and suffered not a man to pass overAnd they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a manSo Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel And the land had rest fourscore yearsAnd after him was Shamgar the son of Anath which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered IsraelAnd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD when Ehud was deadAnd the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor the captain of whose host was Sisera which dwelt in Harosheth of the GentilesAnd the children of Israel cried unto the LORD for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of IsraelAnd Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lapidoth she judged Israel at that timeAnd she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her for judgmentAnd she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali and said unto him Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded saying Go and draw toward mount Tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of ZebulunAnd I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera the captain of Jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and I will deliver him into thine handAnd Barak said unto her If thou wilt go with me then I will go but if thou wilt not go with me then I will not goAnd she said I will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman And Deborah arose and went with Barak to KedeshAnd Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet and Deborah went up with himNow Heber the Kenite which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim which is by KedeshAnd they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount TaborAnd Sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of KishonAnd Deborah said unto Barak Up for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand is not the LORD gone out before thee So Barak went down from mount Tabor and ten thousand men after himAnd the LORD discomfited Sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before Barak so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feetBut Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword and there was not a man leftHowbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the KeniteAnd Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him Turn in my lord turn in to me fear not And when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantleAnd he said unto her Give me I pray thee a little water to drink for I am thirsty And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered himAgain he said unto her Stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and inquire of thee and say Is there any man here that thou shalt say NoThen Jael Hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary So he diedAnd behold as Barak pursued Sisera Jael came out to meet him and said unto him Come and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest And when he came into her tent behold Sisera lay dead and the nail was in his templesSo God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of IsraelAnd the hand of the children of Israel prospered and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan until they had destroyed Jabin king of CanaanThen sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day sayingPraise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel when the people willingly offered themselvesHear O ye kings give ear O ye princes I even I will sing unto the LORD I will sing praise to the LORD God of IsraelLORD when thou wentest out of Seir when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped waterThe mountains melted from before the LORD even that Sinai from before the LORD God of IsraelIn the days of Shamgar the son of Anath in the days of Jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through bywaysThe inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in Israel until that I Deborah arose that I arose a mother in IsraelThey chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in IsraelMy heart is toward the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people Bless ye the LORDSpeak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the wayThey that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gatesAwake awake Deborah awake awake utter a song arise Barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of AbinoamThen he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people the LORD made me have dominion over the mightyOut of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek after thee Benjamin among thy people out of Machir came down governors and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writerAnd the princes of Issachar were with Deborah even Issachar and also Barak he was sent on foot into the valley For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heartWhy abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heartGilead abode beyond Jordan and why did Dan remain in ships Asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breachesZebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the fieldThe kings came and fought then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo they took no gain of moneyThey fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against SiseraThe river of Kishon swept them away that ancient river the river Kishon O my soul thou hast trodden down strengthThen were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty onesCurse ye Meroz said the angel of the LORD curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the LORD to the help of the LORD against the mightyBlessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tentHe asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dishShe put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmens hammer and with the hammer she smote Sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his templesAt her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down deadThe mother of Sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattice Why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariotsHer wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herselfHave they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to Sisera a prey of divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoilSo let all thine enemies perish O LORD but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might And the land had rest forty yearsAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven yearsAnd the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holdsAnd so it was when Israel had sown that the Midianites came up and the Amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against themAnd they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor ox nor assFor they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy itAnd Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites and the children of Israel cried unto the LORDAnd it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the MidianitesThat the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondageAnd I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their landAnd I said unto you I am the LORD your God fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voiceAnd there came an angel of the LORD and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the MidianitesAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto him and said unto him The LORD is with thee thou mighty man of valourAnd Gideon said unto him Oh my Lord if the LORD be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt but now the LORD hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the MidianitesAnd the LORD looked upon him and said Go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites have not I sent theeAnd he said unto him Oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my fathers houseAnd the LORD said unto him Surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one manAnd he said unto him If now I have found grace in thy sight then shew me a sign that thou talkest with meDepart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee And he said I will tarry until thou come againAnd Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented itAnd the angel of God said unto him Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth And he did soThen the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sightAnd when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD Gideon said Alas O Lord GOD for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to faceAnd the LORD said unto him Peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not dieThen Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD and called it Jehovah-shalom unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezritesAnd it came to pass the same night that the LORD said unto him Take thy fathers young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by itAnd build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut downThen Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had said unto him and so it was because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by nightAnd when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of Baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was builtAnd they said one to another Who hath done this thing And when they inquired and asked they said Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thingThen the men of the city said unto Joash Bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of Baal and because he hath cut down the grove that was by itAnd Joash said unto all that stood against him Will ye plead for Baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altarTherefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal saying Let Baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altarThen all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of JezreelBut the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon and he blew a trumpet and Abi-ezer was gathered after himAnd he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto Asher and unto Zebulun and unto Naphtali and they came up to meet themAnd Gideon said unto God If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou hast saidBehold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou hast saidAnd it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of waterAnd Gideon said unto God Let not thine anger be hot against me and I will speak but this once let me prove I pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dewAnd God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the groundThen Jerubbaal who is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of Harod so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valleyAnd the LORD said unto Gideon The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands lest Israel vaunt themselves against me saying Mine own hand hath saved meNow therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying Whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount Gilead And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousandAnd the LORD said unto Gideon The people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and I will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee This shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee This shall not go with thee the same shall not goSo he brought down the people unto the water and the LORD said unto Gideon Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drinkAnd the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink waterAnd the LORD said unto Gideon By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you and deliver the Midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his placeSo the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valleyAnd it came to pass the same night that the LORD said unto him Arise get thee down unto the host for I have delivered it into thine handBut if thou fear to go down go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the hostAnd thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the hostAnd the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitudeAnd when Gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said Behold I dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay alongAnd his fellow answered and said This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash a man of Israel for into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the hostAnd it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of Israel and said Arise for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of MidianAnd he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchersAnd he said unto them Look on me and do likewise and behold when I come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as I do so shall ye doWhen I blow with a trumpet I and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say The sword of the LORD and of GideonSo Gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their handsAnd the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried The sword of the LORD and of GideonAnd they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fledAnd the three hundred blew the trumpets and the LORD set every mans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath and to the border of Abel-meholah unto TabbathAnd the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh and pursued after the MidianitesAnd Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim saying Come down against the Midianites and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto Beth-barah and JordanAnd they took two princes of the Midianites Oreb and Zeeb and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb and pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side JordanAnd the men of Ephraim said unto him Why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites And they did chide with him sharplyAnd he said unto them What have I done now in comparison of you Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezerGod hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian Oreb and Zeeb and what was I able to do in comparison of you Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said thatAnd Gideon came to Jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing themAnd he said unto the men of Succoth Give I pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of MidianAnd the princes of Succoth said Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine armyAnd Gideon said Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briersAnd he went up thence to Penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered himAnd he spake also unto the men of Penuel saying When I come again in peace I will break down this towerNow Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew swordAnd Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secureAnd when Zebah and Zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and discomfited all the hostAnd Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was upAnd caught a young man of the men of Succoth and inquired of him and he described unto him the princes of Succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen menAnd he came unto the men of Succoth and said Behold Zebah and Zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are wearyAnd he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of SuccothAnd he beat down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the cityThen said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor And they answered As thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a kingAnd he said They were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the LORD liveth if ye had saved them alive I would not slay youAnd he said unto Jether his firstborn Up and slay them But the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youthThen Zebah and Zalmunna said Rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necksThen the men of Israel said unto Gideon Rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of MidianAnd Gideon said unto them I will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the LORD shall rule over youAnd Gideon said unto them I would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey For they had golden earrings because they were IshmaelitesAnd they answered We will willingly give them And they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his preyAnd the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necksAnd Gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in Ophrah and all Israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto Gideon and to his houseThus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel so that they lifted up their heads no more And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of GideonAnd Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own houseAnd Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wivesAnd his concubine that was in Shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called AbimelechAnd Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abi-ezritesAnd it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead that the children of Israel turned again and went a whoring after Baalim and made Baal-berith their godAnd the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every sideNeither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal namely Gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto IsraelAnd Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father sayingSpeak I pray you in the ears of all the men of Shechem Whether is better for you either that all the sons of Jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that I am your bone and your fleshAnd his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech for they said He is our brotherAnd they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed himAnd he went unto his fathers house at Ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left for he hid himselfAnd all the men of Shechem gathered together and all the house of Millo and went and made Abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in ShechemAnd when they told it to Jotham he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them Hearken unto me ye men of Shechem that God may hearken unto youThe trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree Reign thou over usBut the olive tree said unto them Should I leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour God and man and go to be promoted over the treesAnd the trees said to the fig tree Come thou and reign over usBut the fig tree said unto them Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the treesThen said the trees unto the vine Come thou and reign over usAnd the vine said unto them Should I leave my wine which cheereth God and man and go to be promoted over the treesThen said all the trees unto the bramble Come thou and reign over usAnd the bramble said unto the trees If in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of LebanonNow therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made Abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his handsFor my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of MidianAnd ye are risen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made Abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of Shechem because he is your brotherIf ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in Abimelech and let him also rejoice in youBut if not let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Millo and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo and devour AbimelechAnd Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his brotherWhen Abimelech had reigned three years over IsraelThen God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with AbimelechThat the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of Shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethrenAnd the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told AbimelechAnd Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren and went over to Shechem and the men of Shechem put their confidence in himAnd they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed AbimelechAnd Gaal the son of Ebed said Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem for why should we serve himAnd would to God this people were under my hand then would I remove Abimelech And he said to Abimelech Increase thine army and come outAnd when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed his anger was kindledAnd he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily saying Behold Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem and behold they fortify the city against theeNow therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the fieldAnd it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasionAnd Abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against Shechem in four companiesAnd Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and Abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from lying in waitAnd when Gaal saw the people he said to Zebul Behold there come people down from the top of the mountains And Zebul said unto him Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were menAnd Gaal spake again and said See there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of MeonenimThen said Zebul unto him Where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst Who is Abimelech that we should serve him is not this the people that thou hast despised go out I pray now and fight with themAnd Gaal went out before the men of Shechem and fought with AbimelechAnd Abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gateAnd Abimelech dwelt at Arumah and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in ShechemAnd it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told AbimelechAnd he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote themAnd Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew themAnd Abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with saltAnd when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that they entered into an hold of the house of the god BerithAnd it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered togetherAnd Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon he and all the people that were with him and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him What ye have seen me do make haste and do as I have doneAnd all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed Abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also about a thousand men and womenThen went Abimelech to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and took itBut there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the towerAnd Abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fireAnd a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelechs head and all to brake his skullThen he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and said unto him Draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me A woman slew him And his young man thrust him through and he diedAnd when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his placeThus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethrenAnd all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of JerubbaalAnd after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah the son of Dodo a man of Issachar and he dwelt in Shamir in mount EphraimAnd he judged Israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in ShamirAnd after him arose Jair a Gileadite and judged Israel twenty and two yearsAnd he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called Havoth-jair unto this day which are in the land of GileadAnd Jair died and was buried in CamonAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD and served Baalim and Ashtaroth and the gods of Syria and the gods of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines and forsook the LORD and served not himAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of AmmonAnd that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites which is in GileadMoreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim so that Israel was sore distressedAnd the children of Israel cried unto the LORD saying We have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our God and also served BaalimAnd the LORD said unto the children of Israel Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites from the children of Ammon and from the PhilistinesThe Zidonians also and the Amalekites and the Maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and I delivered you out of their handYet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore I will deliver you no moreGo and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulationAnd the children of Israel said unto the LORD We have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we pray thee this dayAnd they put away the strange gods from among them and served the LORD and his soul was grieved for the misery of IsraelThen the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead And the children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in MizpehAnd the people and princes of Gilead said one to another What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of GileadNow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was the son of an harlot and Gilead begat JephthahAnd Gileads wife bare him sons and his wifes sons grew up and they thrust out Jephthah and said unto him Thou shalt not inherit in our fathers house for thou art the son of a strange womanThen Jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of Tob and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah and went out with himAnd it came to pass in process of time that the children of Ammon made war against IsraelAnd it was so that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of TobAnd they said unto Jephthah Come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of AmmonAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead Did not ye hate me and expel me out of my fathers house and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distressAnd the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah Therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of GileadAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon and the LORD deliver them before me shall I be your headAnd the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah The LORD be witness between us if we do not so according to thy wordsThen Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead and the people made him head and captain over them and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in MizpehAnd Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon saying What hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my landAnd the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt from Arnon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceablyAnd Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of AmmonAnd said unto him Thus saith Jephthah Israel took not away the land of Moab nor the land of the children of AmmonBut when Israel came up from Egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea and came to KadeshThen Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom saying Let me I pray thee pass through thy land but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab but he would not consent and Israel abode in KadeshThen they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east side of the land of Moab and pitched on the other side of Arnon but came not within the border of Moab for Arnon was the border of MoabAnd Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites the king of Heshbon and Israel said unto him Let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my placeBut Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast but Sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in Jahaz and fought against IsraelAnd the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel and they smote them so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites the inhabitants of that countryAnd they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites from Arnon even unto Jabbok and from the wilderness even unto JordanSo now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel and shouldest thou possess itWilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us them will we possessAnd now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab did he ever strive against Israel or did he ever fight against themWhile Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns and in Aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover them within that timeWherefore I have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of AmmonHowbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent himThen the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of AmmonAnd Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD and said If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine handsThen it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the LORDs and I will offer it up for a burnt offeringSo Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the LORD delivered them into his handsAnd he smote them from Aroer even till thou come to Minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of IsraelAnd Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughterAnd it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said Alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD and I cannot go backAnd she said unto him My father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of AmmonAnd she said unto her father Let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that I may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity I and my fellowsAnd he said Go And he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountainsAnd it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man And it was a custom in IsraelThat the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a yearAnd the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto Jephthah Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fireAnd Jephthah said unto them I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon and when I called you ye delivered me not out of their handsAnd when I saw that ye delivered me not I put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of Ammon and the LORD delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against meThen Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they said Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the ManassitesAnd the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites and it was so that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said Let me go over that the men of Gilead said unto him Art thou an Ephraimite If he said NayThen said they unto him Say now Shibboleth and he said Sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right Then they took him and slew him at the passages of Jordan and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousandAnd Jephthah judged Israel six years Then died Jephthah the Gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of GileadAnd after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged IsraelAnd he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons And he judged Israel seven yearsThen died Ibzan and was buried at BethlehemAnd after him Elon a Zebulonite judged Israel and he judged Israel ten yearsAnd Elon the Zebulonite died and was buried in Aijalon in the country of ZebulunAnd after him Abdon the son of Hillel a Pirathonite judged IsraelAnd he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on threescore and ten ass colts and he judged Israel eight yearsAnd Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the mount of the AmalekitesAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty yearsAnd there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah and his wife was barren and bare notAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman and said unto her Behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a sonNow therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thingFor lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no rasor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the PhilistinesThen the woman came and told her husband saying A man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told he me his nameBut he said unto me Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his deathThen Manoah intreated the LORD and said O my Lord let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be bornAnd God hearkened to the voice of Manoah and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but Manoah her husband was not with herAnd the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and said unto him Behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other dayAnd Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman And he said I amAnd Manoah said Now let thy words come to pass How shall we order the child and how shall we do unto himAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah Of all that I said unto the woman let her bewareShe may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that I commanded her let her observeAnd Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD I pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for theeAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah Though thou detain me I will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the LORD For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORDAnd Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD What is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honourAnd the angel of the LORD said unto him Why askest thou thus after my name seeing it is secretSo Manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD and the angel did wondrously and Manoah and his wife looked onFor it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar And Manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the groundBut the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORDAnd Manoah said unto his wife We shall surely die because we have seen GodBut his wife said unto him If the LORD were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as at this time have told us such things as theseAnd the woman bare a son and called his name Samson and the child grew and the LORD blessed himAnd the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and EshtaolAnd Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the PhilistinesAnd he came up and told his father and his mother and said I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines now therefore get her for me to wifeThen his father and his mother said unto him Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines And Samson said unto his father Get her for me for she pleaseth me wellBut his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD that he sought an occasion against the Philistines for at that time the Philistines had dominion over IsraelThen went Samson down and his father and his mother to Timnath and came to the vineyards of Timnath and behold a young lion roared against himAnd the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had doneAnd he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased Samson wellAnd after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lionAnd he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lionSo his father went down unto the woman and Samson made there a feast for so used the young men to doAnd it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with himAnd Samson said unto them I will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garmentsBut if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments And they said unto him Put forth thy riddle that we may hear itAnd he said unto them Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness And they could not in three days expound the riddleAnd it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto Samsons wife Entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have ye called us to take that we have is it not soAnd Samsons wife wept before him and said Thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me And he said unto her Behold I have not told it my father nor my mother and shall I tell it theeAnd she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her peopleAnd the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down What is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion And he said unto them If ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddleAnd the Spirit of the LORD came upon him and he went down to Ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle And his anger was kindled and he went up to his fathers houseBut Samsons wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friendBut it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that Samson visited his wife with a kid and he said I will go in to my wife into the chamber But her father would not suffer him to go inAnd her father said I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore I gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her I pray thee instead of herAnd Samson said concerning them Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines though I do them a displeasureAnd Samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tailsAnd when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olivesThen the Philistines said Who hath done this And they answered Samson the son in law of the Timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion And the Philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fireAnd Samson said unto them Though ye have done this yet will I be avenged of you and after that I will ceaseAnd he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock EtamThen the Philistines went up and pitched in Judah and spread themselves in LehiAnd the men of Judah said Why are ye come up against us And they answered To bind Samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to usThen three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam and said to Samson Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us And he said unto them As they did unto me so have I done unto themAnd they said unto him We are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines And Samson said unto them Swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselvesAnd they spake unto him saying No but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee And they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rockAnd when he came unto Lehi the Philistines shouted against him and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his handsAnd he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewithAnd Samson said With the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand menAnd it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place Ramath-lehiAnd he was sore athirst and called on the LORD and said Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall I die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcisedBut God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore which is in Lehi unto this dayAnd he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty yearsThen went Samson to Gaza and saw there an harlot and went in unto herAnd it was told the Gazites saying Samson is come hither And they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying In the morning when it is day we shall kill himAnd Samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before HebronAnd it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek whose name was DelilahAnd the lords of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her Entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silverAnd Delilah said to Samson Tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict theeAnd Samson said unto her If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall I be weak and be as another manThen the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried and she bound him with themNow there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber And she said unto him The Philistines be upon thee Samson And he brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire So his strength was not knownAnd Delilah said unto Samson Behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me I pray thee wherewith thou mightest be boundAnd he said unto her If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall I be weak and be as another manDelilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him The Philistines be upon thee Samson And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber And he brake them from off his arms like a threadAnd Delilah said unto Samson Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound And he said unto her If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the webAnd she fastened it with the pin and said unto him The Philistines be upon thee Samson And he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the webAnd she said unto him How canst thou say I love thee when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength liethAnd it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto deathThat he told her all his heart and said unto her There hath not come a rasor upon mine head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mothers womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other manAnd when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines saying Come up this once for he hath shewed me all his heart Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their handAnd she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from himAnd she said The Philistines be upon thee Samson And he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself And he wist not that the LORD was departed from himBut the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison houseHowbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shavenThen the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god and to rejoice for they said Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our handAnd when the people saw him they praised their god for they said Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of usAnd it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said Call for Samson that he may make us sport And they called for Samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillarsAnd Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I may lean upon themNow the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while Samson made sportAnd Samson called unto the LORD and said O Lord GOD remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once O God that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyesAnd Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his leftAnd Samson said Let me die with the Philistines And he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his lifeThen his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying place of Manoah his father And he judged Israel twenty yearsAnd there was a man of mount Ephraim whose name was MicahAnd he said unto his mother The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me I took it And his mother said Blessed be thou of the LORD my sonAnd when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore I will restore it unto theeYet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of MicahAnd the man Micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priestIn those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyesAnd there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah who was a Levite and he sojourned thereAnd the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah as he journeyedAnd Micah said unto him Whence comest thou And he said unto him I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah and I go to sojourn where I may find a placeAnd Micah said unto him Dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals So the Levite went inAnd the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sonsAnd Micah consecrated the Levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of MicahThen said Micah Now know I that the LORD will do me good seeing I have a Levite to my priestIn those days there was no king in Israel and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of IsraelAnd the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from Zorah and from Eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them Go search the land who when they came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah they lodged thereWhen they were by the house of Micah they knew the voice of the young man the Levite and they turned in thither and said unto him Who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou hereAnd he said unto them Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me and hath hired me and I am his priestAnd they said unto him Ask counsel we pray thee of God that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperousAnd the priest said unto them Go in peace before the LORD is your way wherein ye goThen the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the Zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the Zidonians and had no business with any manAnd they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol and their brethren said unto them What say yeAnd they said Arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the landWhen ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for God hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earthAnd there went from thence of the family of the Danites out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of warAnd they went up and pitched in Kirjath-jearim in Judah wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day behold it is behind Kirjath-jearimAnd they passed thence unto mount Ephraim and came unto the house of MicahThen answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish and said unto their brethren Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to doAnd they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the Levite even unto the house of Micah and saluted himAnd the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of Dan stood by the entering of the gateAnd the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of warAnd these went into Micahs house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image Then said the priest unto them What do yeAnd they said unto him Hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in IsraelAnd the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the peopleSo they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before themAnd when they were a good way from the house of Micah the men that were in the houses near to Micahs house were gathered together and overtook the children of DanAnd they cried unto the children of Dan And they turned their faces and said unto Micah What aileth thee that thou comest with such a companyAnd he said Ye have taken away my gods which I made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have I more and what is this that ye say unto me What aileth theeAnd the children of Dan said unto him Let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy householdAnd the children of Dan went their way and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his houseAnd they took the things which Micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto Laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fireAnd there was no deliverer because it was far from Zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob And they built a city and dwelt thereinAnd they called the name of the city Dan after the name of Dan their father who was born unto Israel howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the firstAnd the children of Dan set up the graven image and Jonathan the son of Gershom the son of Manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the landAnd they set them up Micahs graven image which he made all the time that the house of God was in ShilohAnd it came to pass in those days when there was no king in Israel that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim who took to him a concubine out of BethlehemjudahAnd his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her fathers house to Bethlehemjudah and was there four whole monthsAnd her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet himAnd his father in law the damsels father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged thereAnd it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father said unto his son in law Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your wayAnd they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsels father had said unto the man Be content I pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merryAnd when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there againAnd he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsels father said Comfort thine heart I pray thee And they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of themAnd when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsels father said unto him Behold now the day draweth toward evening I pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go homeBut the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against Jebus which is Jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with himAnd when they were by Jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master Come I pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in itAnd his master said unto him We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of Israel we will pass over to GibeahAnd he said unto his servant Come and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night in Gibeah or in RamahAnd they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah which belongeth to BenjaminAnd they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in Gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodgingAnd behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount Ephraim and he sojourned in Gibeah but the men of the place were BenjamitesAnd when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said Whither goest thou and whence comest thouAnd he said unto him We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim from thence am I and I went to Bethlehemjudah but I am now going to the house of the LORD and there is no man that receiveth me to houseYet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thingAnd the old man said Peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the streetSo he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drinkNow as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain sons of Belial beset the house round about and beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying Bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know himAnd the man the master of the house went out unto them Nay my brethren nay I pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this follyBehold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them I will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thingBut the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her goThen came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the mans house where her lord was till it was lightAnd her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the thresholdAnd he said unto her Up and let us be going But none answered Then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his placeAnd when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of IsraelAnd it was so that all that saw it said There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and speak your mindsThen all the children of Israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man from Dan even to Beer-sheba with the land of Gilead unto the LORD in MizpehAnd the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God four hundred thousand footmen that drew swordNow the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh Then said the children of Israel Tell us how was this wickednessAnd the Levite the husband of the woman that was slain answered and said I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin I and my concubine to lodgeAnd the men of Gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine have they forced that she is deadAnd I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in IsraelBehold ye are all children of Israel give here your advice and counselAnd all the people arose as one man saying We will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his houseBut now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah we will go up by lot against itAnd we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel and an hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the people that they may do when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in IsraelSo all the men of Israel were gathered against the city knit together as one manAnd the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying What wickedness is this that is done among youNow therefore deliver us the men the children of Belial which are in Gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of IsraelBut the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah to go out to battle against the children of IsraelAnd the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the inhabitants of Gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen menAmong all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not missAnd the men of Israel beside Benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of warAnd the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God and said Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin And the LORD said Judah shall go up firstAnd the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against GibeahAnd the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at GibeahAnd the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand menAnd the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first dayAnd the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even and asked counsel of the LORD saying Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother And the LORD said Go up against himAnd the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second dayAnd Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the swordThen all the children of Israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of God and wept and sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORDAnd the children of Israel inquired of the LORD for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those daysAnd Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days saying Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother or shall I cease And the LORD said Go up for to morrow I will deliver them into thine handAnd Israel set liers in wait round about GibeahAnd the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against Gibeah as at other timesAnd the children of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to the house of God and the other to Gibeah in the field about thirty men of IsraelAnd the children of Benjamin said They are smitten down before us as at the first But the children of Israel said Let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highwaysAnd all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places even out of the meadows of GibeahAnd there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near themAnd the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men all these drew the swordSo the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside GibeahAnd the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon Gibeah and the liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the swordNow there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the cityAnd when the men of Israel retired in the battle Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons for they said Surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battleBut when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke the Benjamites looked behind them and behold the flame of the city ascended up to heavenAnd when the men of Israel turned again the men of Benjamin were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon themTherefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of themThus they inclosed the Benjamites round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrisingAnd there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valourAnd they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto Gidom and slew two thousand men of themSo that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valourBut six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon and abode in the rock Rimmon four monthsAnd the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set on fire all the cities that they came toNow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh saying There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wifeAnd the people came to the house of God and abode there till even before God and lifted up their voices and wept soreAnd said O LORD God of Israel why is this come to pass in Israel that there should be to day one tribe lacking in IsraelAnd it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offeringsAnd the children of Israel said Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh saying He shall surely be put to deathAnd the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother and said There is one tribe cut off from Israel this dayHow shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wivesAnd they said What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD And behold there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assemblyFor the people were numbered and behold there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead thereAnd the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the childrenAnd this is the thing that ye shall do Ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by manAnd they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh which is in the land of CanaanAnd the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon and to call peaceably unto themAnd Benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead and yet so they sufficed them notAnd the people repented them for Benjamin because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of IsraelThen the elders of the congregation said How shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of BenjaminAnd they said There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of IsraelHowbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of Israel have sworn saying Cursed be he that giveth a wife to BenjaminThen they said Behold there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem and on the south of LebonahTherefore they commanded the children of Benjamin saying Go and lie in wait in the vineyardsAnd see and behold if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh and go to the land of BenjaminAnd it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain that we will say unto them Be favourable unto them for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be guiltyAnd the children of Benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the cities and dwelt in themAnd the children of Israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritanceIn those days there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyesNow it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sonsAnd the name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah And they came into the country of Moab and continued thereAnd Elimelech Naomis husband died and she was left and her two sonsAnd they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there about ten yearsAnd Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husbandThen she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them breadWherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of JudahAnd Naomi said unto her two daughters in law Go return each to her mothers house the LORD deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with meThe LORD grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband Then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and weptAnd they said unto her Surely we will return with thee unto thy peopleAnd Naomi said Turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbandsTurn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have an husband If I should say I have hope if I should have an husband also to night and should also bear sonsWould ye tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against meAnd they lifted up their voice and wept again and Orpah kissed her mother in law but Ruth clave unto herAnd she said Behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in lawAnd Ruth said Intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my GodWhere thou diest will I die and there will I be buried the LORD do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and meWhen she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto herSo they two went until they came to Bethlehem And it came to pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said Is this NaomiAnd she said unto them Call me not Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with meI went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me Naomi seeing the LORD hath testified against me and the Almighty hath afflicted meSo Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvestAnd Naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of Elimelech and his name was BoazAnd Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi Let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace And she said unto her Go my daughterAnd she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was of the kindred of ElimelechAnd behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the reapers The LORD be with you And they answered him The LORD bless theeThen said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers Whose damsel is thisAnd the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of MoabAnd she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the houseThen said Boaz unto Ruth Hearest thou not my daughter Go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidensLet thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawnThen she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him Why have I found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I am a strangerAnd Boaz answered and said unto her It hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretoforeThe LORD recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel under whose wings thou art come to trustThen she said Let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidensAnd Boaz said unto her At mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar And she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and leftAnd when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying Let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her notAnd let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her notSo she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barleyAnd she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficedAnd her mother in law said unto her Where hast thou gleaned to day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said The mans name with whom I wrought to day is BoazAnd Naomi said unto her daughter in law Blessed be he of the LORD who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead And Naomi said unto her The man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmenAnd Ruth the Moabitess said He said unto me also Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvestAnd Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law It is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other fieldSo she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in lawThen Naomi her mother in law said unto her My daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with theeAnd now is not Boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast Behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloorWash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinkingAnd it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt doAnd she said unto her All that thou sayest unto me I will doAnd she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade herAnd when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her downAnd it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feetAnd he said Who art thou And she answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsmanAnd he said Blessed be thou of the LORD my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or richAnd now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous womanAnd now it is true that I am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than ITarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee as the LORD liveth lie down until the morningAnd she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another And he said Let it not be known that a woman came into the floorAlso he said Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it And when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the cityAnd when she came to her mother in law she said Who art thou my daughter And she told her all that the man had done to herAnd she said These six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me Go not empty unto thy mother in lawThen said she Sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this dayThen went Boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by unto whom he said Ho such a one turn aside sit down here And he turned aside and sat downAnd he took ten men of the elders of the city and said Sit ye down here And they sat downAnd he said unto the kinsman Naomi that is come again out of the country of Moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother ElimelechsAnd I thought to advertise thee saying Buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people If thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee And he said I will redeem itThen said Boaz What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritanceAnd the kinsman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem itNow this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in IsraelTherefore the kinsman said unto Boaz Buy it for thee So he drew off his shoeAnd Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelechs and all that was Chilions and Mahlons of the hand of NaomiMoreover Ruth the Moabitess the wife of Mahlon have I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this dayAnd all the people that were in the gate and the elders said We are witnesses The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah which two did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in Ephratah and be famous in BethlehemAnd let thy house be like the house of Pharez whom Tamar bare unto Judah of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young womanSo Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the LORD gave her conception and she bare a sonAnd the women said unto Naomi Blessed be the LORD which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in IsraelAnd he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born himAnd Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto itAnd the women her neighbours gave it a name saying There is a son born to Naomi and they called his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of DavidNow these are the generations of Pharez Pharez begat HezronAnd Hezron begat Ram and Ram begat AmminadabAnd Amminadab begat Nahshon and Nahshon begat SalmonAnd Salmon begat Boaz and Boaz begat ObedAnd Obed begat Jesse and Jesse begat DavidNow there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of mount Ephraim and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an EphrathiteAnd he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah and Peninnah had children but Hannah had no childrenAnd this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh And the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the LORD were thereAnd when the time was that Elkanah offered he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portionsBut unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the LORD had shut up her wombAnd her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the LORD had shut up her wombAnd as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the LORD so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eatThen said Elkanah her husband to her Hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not I better to thee than ten sonsSo Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORDAnd she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and wept soreAnd she vowed a vow and said O LORD of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life and there shall no rasor come upon his headAnd it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD that Eli marked her mouthNow Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunkenAnd Eli said unto her How long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from theeAnd Hannah answered and said No my lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the LORDCount not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hithertoThen Eli answered and said Go in peace and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of himAnd she said Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight So the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sadAnd they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the LORD and returned and came to their house to Ramah and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the LORD remembered herWherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name Samuel saying Because I have asked him of the LORDAnd the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vowBut Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband I will not go up until the child be weaned and then I will bring him that he may appear before the LORD and there abide for everAnd Elkanah her husband said unto her Do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the LORD establish his word So the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned himAnd when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh and the child was youngAnd they slew a bullock and brought the child to EliAnd she said Oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord I am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the LORDFor this child I prayed and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of himTherefore also I have lent him to the LORD as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD And he worshipped the LORD thereAnd Hannah prayed and said My heart rejoiceth in the LORD mine horn is exalted in the LORD my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because I rejoice in thy salvationThere is none holy as the LORD for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our GodTalk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the LORD is a God of knowledge and by him actions are weighedThe bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strengthThey that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feebleThe LORD killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth upThe LORD maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth upHe raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the LORDs and he hath set the world upon themHe will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevailThe adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointedAnd Elkanah went to Ramah to his house And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priestNow the sons of Eli were sons of Belial they knew not the LORDAnd the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his handAnd he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thitherAlso before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed Give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but rawAnd if any man said unto him Let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him Nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not I will take it by forceWherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD for men abhorred the offering of the LORDBut Samuel ministered before the LORD being a child girded with a linen ephodMoreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrificeAnd Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD And they went unto their own homeAnd the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters And the child Samuel grew before the LORDNow Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregationAnd he said unto them Why do ye such things for I hear of your evil dealings by all this peopleNay my sons for it is no good report that I hear ye make the LORDs people to transgressIf one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the LORD who shall intreat for him Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the LORD would slay themAnd the child Samuel grew on and was in favour both with the LORD and also with menAnd there came a man of God unto Eli and said unto him Thus saith the LORD Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in Pharaohs houseAnd did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of IsraelWherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which I have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my peopleWherefore the LORD God of Israel saith I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the LORD saith Be it far from me for them that honour me I will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemedBehold the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thine houseAnd thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which God shall give Israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for everAnd the man of thine whom I shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their ageAnd this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on Hophni and Phinehas in one day they shall die both of themAnd I will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for everAnd it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say Put me I pray thee into one of the priests offices that I may eat a piece of breadAnd the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli And the word of the LORD was precious in those days there was no open visionAnd it came to pass at that time when Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not seeAnd ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleepThat the LORD called Samuel and he answered Here am IAnd he ran unto Eli and said Here am I for thou calledst me And he said I called not lie down again And he went and lay downAnd the LORD called yet again Samuel And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said Here am I for thou didst call me And he answered I called not my son lie down againNow Samuel did not yet know the LORD neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto himAnd the LORD called Samuel again the third time And he arose and went to Eli and said Here am I for thou didst call me And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the childTherefore Eli said unto Samuel Go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say Speak LORD for thy servant heareth So Samuel went and lay down in his placeAnd the LORD came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel Then Samuel answered Speak for thy servant hearethAnd the LORD said to Samuel Behold I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingleIn that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house when I begin I will also make an endFor I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them notAnd therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for everAnd Samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the LORD And Samuel feared to shew Eli the visionThen Eli called Samuel and said Samuel my son And he answered Here am IAnd he said What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee I pray thee hide it not from me God do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto theeAnd Samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him And he said It is the LORD let him do what seemeth him goodAnd Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and did let none of his words fall to the groundAnd all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORDAnd the LORD appeared again in Shiloh for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORDAnd the word of Samuel came to all Israel Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle and pitched beside Eben-ezer and the Philistines pitched in AphekAnd the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel and when they joined battle Israel was smitten before the Philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand menAnd when the people were come into the camp the elders of Israel said Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemiesSo the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of GodAnd when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp all Israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang againAnd when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout they said What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the campAnd the Philistines were afraid for they said God is come into the camp And they said Woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretoforeWoe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wildernessBe strong and quit yourselves like men O ye Philistines that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fightAnd the Philistines fought and Israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmenAnd the ark of God was taken and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were slainAnd there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his headAnd when he came lo Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of God And when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried outAnd when Eli heard the noise of the crying he said What meaneth the noise of this tumult And the man came in hastily and told EliNow Eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not seeAnd the man said unto Eli I am he that came out of the army and I fled to day out of the army And he said What is there done my sonAnd the messenger answered and said Israel is fled before the Philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also Hophni and Phinehas are dead and the ark of God is takenAnd it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of God that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy And he had judged Israel forty yearsAnd his daughter in law Phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon herAnd about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her Fear not for thou hast born a son But she answered not neither did she regard itAnd she named the child I-chabod saying The glory is departed from Israel because the ark of God was taken and because of her father in law and her husbandAnd she said The glory is departed from Israel for the ark of God is takenAnd the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Eben-ezer unto AshdodWhen the Philistines took the ark of God they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by DagonAnd when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow behold Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD And they took Dagon and set him in his place againAnd when they arose early on the morrow morning behold Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of Dagon was left to himTherefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any that come into Dagons house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this dayBut the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even Ashdod and the coasts thereofAnd when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so they said The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our godThey sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them and said What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel And they answered Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thitherAnd it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret partsTherefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron And it came to pass as the ark of God came to Ekron that the Ekronites cried out saying They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our peopleSo they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of God was very heavy thereAnd the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heavenAnd the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven monthsAnd the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying What shall we do to the ark of the LORD tell us wherewith we shall send it to his placeAnd they said If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from youThen said they What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him They answered Five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the Philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lordsWherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your landWherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharoah hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departedNow therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from themAnd take the ark of the LORD and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may goAnd see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to usAnd the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at homeAnd they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerodsAnd the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemeshAnd they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see itAnd the cart came into the field of Joshua a Beth-shemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORDAnd the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORDAnd when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it they returned to Ekron the same dayAnd these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD for Ashdod one for Gaza one for Askelon one for Gath one for Ekron oneAnd the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of Abel whereon they set down the ark of the LORD which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemiteAnd he smote the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughterAnd the men of Beth-shemesh said Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God and to whom shall he go up from usAnd they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim saying The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD come ye down and fetch it up to youAnd the men of Kirjath-jearim came and fetched up the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORDAnd it came to pass while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORDAnd Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the LORD and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the PhilistinesThen the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth and served the LORD onlyAnd Samuel said Gather all Israel to Mizpeh and I will pray for you unto the LORDAnd they gathered together to Mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there We have sinned against the LORD And Samuel judged the children of Israel in MizpehAnd when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel And when the children of Israel heard it they were afraid of the PhilistinesAnd the children of Israel said to Samuel Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of the PhilistinesAnd Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel and the LORD heard himAnd as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before IsraelAnd the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they came under Beth-carThen Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen and called the name of it Eben-ezer saying Hitherto hath the LORD helped usSo the Philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of Israel and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of SamuelAnd the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron even unto Gath and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines And there was peace between Israel and the AmoritesAnd Samuel judged Israel all the days of his lifeAnd he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpeh and judged Israel in all those placesAnd his return was to Ramah for there was his house and there he judged Israel and there he built an altar unto the LORDAnd it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over IsraelNow the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abiah they were judges in Beer-shebaAnd his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgmentThen all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto RamahAnd said unto him Behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nationsBut the thing displeased Samuel when they said Give us a king to judge us And Samuel prayed unto the LORDAnd the LORD said unto Samuel Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not reign over themAccording to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto theeNow therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over themAnd Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a kingAnd he said This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariotsAnd he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariotsAnd he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakersAnd he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servantsAnd he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servantsAnd he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his workHe will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servantsAnd ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the LORD will not hear you in that dayNevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said Nay but we will have a king over usThat we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battlesAnd Samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORDAnd the LORD said to Samuel Hearken unto their voice and make them a king And Samuel said unto the men of Israel Go ye every man unto his cityNow there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Bechorath the son of Aphiah a Benjamite a mighty man of powerAnd he had a son whose name was Saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the peopleAnd the asses of Kish Sauls father were lost And Kish said to Saul his son Take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the assesAnd he passed through mount Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of Shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the Benjamites but they found them notAnd when they were come to the land of Zuph Saul said to his servant that was with him Come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for usAnd he said unto him Behold now there is in this city a man of God and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should goThen said Saul to his servant But behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of God what have weAnd the servant answered Saul again and said Behold I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will I give to the man of God to tell us our wayBeforetime in Israel when a man went to inquire of God thus he spake Come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a SeerThen said Saul to his servant Well said come let us go So they went unto the city where the man of God wasAnd as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them Is the seer hereAnd they answered them and said He is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high placeAs soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden Now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find himAnd they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold Samuel came out against them for to go up to the high placeNow the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came sayingTo morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines for I have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto meAnd when Samuel saw Saul the LORD said unto him Behold the man whom I spake to thee of this same shall reign over my peopleThen Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said Tell me I pray thee where the seers house isAnd Samuel answered Saul and said I am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heartAnd as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found And on whom is all the desire of Israel Is it not on thee and on all thy fathers houseAnd Saul answered and said Am not I a Benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to meAnd Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty personsAnd Samuel said unto the cook Bring the portion which I gave thee of which I said unto thee Set it by theeAnd the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before Saul And Samuel said Behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said I have invited the people So Saul did eat with Samuel that dayAnd when they were come down from the high place into the city Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the houseAnd they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house saying Up that I may send thee away And Saul arose and they went out both of them he and Samuel abroadAnd as they were going down to the end of the city Samuel said to Saul Bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that I may shew thee the word of GodThen Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritanceWhen thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by Rachels sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah and they will say unto thee The asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying What shall I do for my sonThen shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wineAnd they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their handsAfter that thou shalt come to the hill of God where is the garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesyAnd the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another manAnd let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for God is with theeAnd thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal and behold I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt doAnd it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that dayAnd when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied among themAnd it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another What is this that is come unto the son of Kish Is Saul also among the prophetsAnd one of the same place answered and said But who is their father Therefore it became a proverb Is Saul also among the prophetsAnd when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high placeAnd Sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant Whither went ye And he said To seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to SamuelAnd Sauls uncle said Tell me I pray thee what Samuel said unto youAnd Saul said unto his uncle He told us plainly that the asses were found But of the matter of the kingdom whereof Samuel spake he told him notAnd Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to MizpehAnd said unto the children of Israel Thus saith the LORD God of Israel I brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed youAnd ye have this day rejected your God who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him Nay but set a king over us Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousandsAnd when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near the tribe of Benjamin was takenWhen he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families the family of Matri was taken and Saul the son of Kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be foundTherefore they inquired of the LORD further if the man should yet come thither And the LORD answered Behold he hath hid himself among the stuffAnd they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upwardAnd Samuel said to all the people See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people And all the people shouted and said God save the kingThen Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD And Samuel sent all the people away every man to his houseAnd Saul also went home to Gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts God had touchedBut the children of Belial said How shall this man save us And they despised him and brought him no presents But he held his peaceThen Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash Make a covenant with us and we will serve theeAnd Nahash the Ammonite answered them On this condition will I make a covenant with you that I may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all IsraelAnd the elders of Jabesh said unto him Give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to theeThen came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and weptAnd behold Saul came after the herd out of the field and Saul said What aileth the people that they weep And they told him the tidings of the men of JabeshAnd the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatlyAnd he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers saying Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen And the fear of the LORD fell on the people and they came out with one consentAnd when he numbered them in Bezek the children of Israel were three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousandAnd they said unto the messengers that came Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead To morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh and they were gladTherefore the men of Jabesh said To morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto youAnd it was so on the morrow that Saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left togetherAnd the people said unto Samuel Who is he that said Shall Saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to deathAnd Saul said There shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in IsraelThen said Samuel to the people Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom thereAnd all the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatlyAnd Samuel said unto all Israel Behold I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over youAnd now behold the king walketh before you and I am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this dayBehold here I am witness against me before the LORD and before his anointed whose ox have I taken or whose ass have I taken or whom have I defrauded whom have I oppressed or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and I will restore it youAnd they said Thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any mans handAnd he said unto them The LORD is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand And they answered He is witnessAnd Samuel said unto the people It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of EgyptNow therefore stand still that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD which he did to you and to your fathersWhen Jacob was come into Egypt and your fathers cried unto the LORD then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this placeAnd when they forgat the LORD their God he sold them into the hand of Sisera captain of the host of Hazor and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab and they fought against themAnd they cried unto the LORD and said We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve theeAnd the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safeAnd when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you ye said unto me Nay but a king shall reign over us when the LORD your God was your kingNow therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the LORD hath set a king over youIf ye will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your GodBut if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD but rebel against the commandment of the LORD then shall the hand of the LORD be against you as it was against your fathersNow therefore stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyesIs it not wheat harvest to day I will call unto the LORD and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the LORD in asking you a kingSo Samuel called unto the LORD and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the LORD and SamuelAnd all the people said unto Samuel Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a kingAnd Samuel said unto the people Fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the LORD but serve the LORD with all your heartAnd turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vainFor the LORD will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his peopleMoreover as for me God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right wayOnly fear the LORD and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for youBut if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your kingSaul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over IsraelSaul chose him three thousand men of Israel whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tentAnd Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba and the Philistines heard of it And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying Let the Hebrews hearAnd all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines And the people were called together after Saul to GilgalAnd the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in Michmash eastward from Beth-avenWhen the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pitsAnd some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead As for Saul he was yet in Gilgal and all the people followed him tremblingAnd he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to Gilgal and the people were scattered from himAnd Saul said Bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings And he offered the burnt offeringAnd it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute himAnd Samuel said What hast thou done And Saul said Because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at MichmashTherefore said I The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication unto the LORD I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offeringAnd Samuel said to Saul Thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which he commanded thee for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for everBut now thy kingdom shall not continue the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded theeAnd Samuel arose and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin And Saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred menAnd Saul and Jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in Gibeah of Benjamin but the Philistines encamped in MichmashAnd the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah unto the land of ShualA nd anot her company turned the way to Beth-horon and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wildernessNow there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel for the Philistines said Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spearsBut all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattockYet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goadsSo it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there foundAnd the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of MichmashNow it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour Come and let us go over to the Philistines garrison that is on the other side But he told not his fatherAnd Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred menAnd Ahiah the son of Ahitub I-chabods brother the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the LORDs priest in Shiloh wearing an ephod And the people knew not that Jonathan was goneAnd between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other SenehThe forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash and the other southward over against GibeahAnd Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the LORD will work for us for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by fewAnd his armourbearer said unto him Do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold I am with thee according to thy heartThen said Jonathan Behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto themIf they say thus unto us Tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto themBut if they say thus Come up unto us then we will go up for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto usAnd both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines and the Philistines said Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselvesAnd the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer and said Come up to us and we will shew you a thing And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer Come up after me for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of IsraelAnd Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before Jonathan and his armourbearer slew after himAnd that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plowAnd there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great tremblingAnd the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one anotherThen said Saul unto the people that were with him Number now and see who is gone from us And when they had numbered behold Jonathan and his armourbearer were not thereAnd Saul said unto Ahiah Bring hither the ark of God For the ark of God was at that time with the children of IsraelAnd it came to pass while Saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased and Saul said unto the priest Withdraw thine handAnd Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every mans sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfitureMoreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and JonathanLikewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim when they heard that the Philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battleSo the LORD saved Israel that day and the battle passed over unto Beth-avenAnd the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had adjured the people saying Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged on mine enemies So none of the people tasted any foodAnd all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the groundAnd when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oathBut Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightenedThen answered one of the people and said Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day And the people were faintThen said Jonathan My father hath troubled the land see I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honeyHow much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the PhilistinesAnd they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon and the people were very faintAnd the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the bloodThen they told Saul saying Behold the people sin against the LORD in that they eat with the blood And he said Ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this dayAnd Saul said Disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them Bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them thereAnd Saul built an altar unto the LORD the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORDAnd Saul said Let us go down after the Philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them And they said Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee Then said the priest Let us draw near hither unto GodAnd Saul asked counsel of God Shall I go down after the Philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel But he answered him not that dayAnd Saul said Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this dayFor as the LORD liveth which saveth Israel though it be in Jonathan my son he shall surely die But there was not a man among all the people that answered himThen said he unto all Israel Be ye on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side And the people said unto Saul Do what seemeth good unto theeTherefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel Give a perfect lot And Saul and Jonathan were taken but the people escapedAnd Saul said Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son And Jonathan was takenThen Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what thou hast done And Jonathan told him and said I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo I must dieAnd Saul answered God do so and more also for thou shalt surely die JonathanAnd the people said unto Saul Shall Jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel God forbid as the LORD liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with God this day So the people rescued Jonathan that he died notThen Saul went up from following the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own placeSo Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against Moab and against the children of Ammon and against Edom and against the kings of Zobah and against the Philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed themAnd he gathered an host and smote the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled themNow the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishui and Melchi-shua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger MichalAnd the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner Sauls uncleAnd Kish was the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner was the son of AbielAnd there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul and when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto himSamuel also said unto Saul The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORDThus saith the LORD of hosts I remember that which Amalek did to Israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from EgyptNow go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and assAnd Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of JudahAnd Saul came to a city of Amalek and laid wait in the valleyAnd Saul said unto the Kenites Go depart get you down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt So the Kenites departed from among the AmalekitesAnd Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur that is over against EgyptAnd he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the swordBut Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterlyThen came the word of the LORD unto Samuel sayingIt repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments And it grieved Samuel and he cried unto the LORD all nightAnd when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to GilgalAnd Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him Blessed be thou of the LORD I have performed the commandment of the LORDAnd Samuel said What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hearAnd Saul said They have brought them from the Amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyedThen Samuel said unto Saul Stay and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night And he said unto him Say onAnd Samuel said When thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the LORD anointed thee king over IsraelAnd the LORD sent thee on a journey and said Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites and fight against them until they be consumedWherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the LORDAnd Saul said unto Samuel Yea I have obeyed the voice of the LORD and have gone the way which the LORD sent me and have brought Agag the king of Amalek and have utterly destroyed the AmalekitesBut the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in GilgalAnd Samuel said Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD Behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of ramsFor rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD he hath also rejected thee from being kingAnd Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voiceNow therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may worship the LORDAnd Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over IsraelAnd as Samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rentAnd Samuel said unto him The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thouAnd also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repentThen he said I have sinned yet honour me now I pray thee before the elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may worship the LORD thy GodSo Samuel turned again after Saul and Saul worshipped the LORDThen said Samuel Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites And Agag came unto him delicately And Agag said Surely the bitterness of death is pastAnd Samuel said As thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in GilgalThen Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of SaulAnd Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over IsraelAnd the LORD said unto Samuel How long wilt thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sonsAnd Samuel said How can I go if Saul hear it he Will kill me And the LORD said Take an heifer with thee and say I am come to sacrifice to the LORDAnd call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto theeAnd Samuel did that which the LORD spake and came to Bethlehem And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said Comest thou peaceablyAnd he said Peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrificeAnd it came to pass when they were come that he looked on Eliab and said Surely the LORDs anointed is before himBut the LORD said unto Samuel Look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the LORD seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the LORD looketh on the heartThen Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel And he said Neither hath the LORD chosen thisThen Jesse made Shammah to pass by And he said Neither hath the LORD chosen thisAgain Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel And Samuel said unto Jesse The LORD hath not chosen theseAnd Samuel said unto Jesse Are here all thy children And he said There remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep And Samuel said unto Jesse Send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hitherAnd he sent and brought him in Now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to And the LORD said Arise anoint him for this is heThen Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward So Samuel rose up and went to RamahBut the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled himAnd Sauls servants said unto him Behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth theeLet our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be wellAnd Saul said unto his servants Provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to meThen answered one of the servants and said Behold I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the LORD is with himWherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said Send me David thy son which is with the sheepAnd Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by David his son unto SaulAnd David came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearerAnd Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David I pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sightAnd it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took an harp and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from himNow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at Shochoh which belongeth to Judah and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammimAnd Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of Elah and set the battle in array against the PhilistinesAnd the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between themAnd there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a spanAnd he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brassAnd he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shouldersAnd the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before himAnd he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them Why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not I a Philistine and ye servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to meIf he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve usAnd the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight togetherWhen Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraidNow David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah whose name was Jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of SaulAnd the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn and next unto him Abinadab and the third ShammahAnd David was the youngest and the three eldest followed SaulBut David went and returned from Saul to feed his fathers sheep at BethlehemAnd the Philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty daysAnd Jesse said unto David his son Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethrenAnd carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledgeNow Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting with the PhilistinesAnd David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as Jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battleFor Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array army against armyAnd David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethrenAnd as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the Philistine of Gath Goliath by name out of the armies of the Philistines and spake according to the same words and David heard themAnd all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraidAnd the men of Israel said Have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in IsraelAnd David spake to the men that stood by him saying What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living GodAnd the people answered him after this manner saying So shall it be done to the man that killeth himAnd Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and Eliabs anger was kindled against David and he said Why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battleAnd David said What have I now done Is there not a causeAnd he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former mannerAnd when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he sent for himAnd David said to Saul Let no mans heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this PhilistineAnd Saul said to David Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youthAnd David said unto Saul Thy servant kept his fathers sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flockAnd I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew himThy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living GodDavid said moreover The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine And Saul said unto David Go and the LORD be with theeAnd Saul armed David with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mailAnd David girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it And David said unto Saul I cannot go with these for I have not proved them And David put them off himAnd he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the PhilistineAnd the Philistine came on and drew near unto David and the man that bare the shield went before himAnd when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenanceAnd the Philistine said unto David Am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves And the Philistine cursed David by his godsAnd the Philistine said to David Come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the fieldThen said David to the Philistine Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou hast defiedThis day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a God in IsraelAnd all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the LORDs and he will give you into our handsAnd it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David that David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the PhilistineAnd David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earthSo David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of DavidTherefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead they fledAnd the men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of Ekron And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim even unto Gath and unto EkronAnd the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they spoiled their tentsAnd David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem but he put his armour in his tentAnd when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine he said unto Abner the captain of the host Abner whose son is this youth And Abner said As thy soul liveth O king I cannot tellAnd the king said Inquire thou whose son the stripling isAnd as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his handAnd Saul said to him Whose son art thou thou young man And David answered I am the son of thy servant Jesse the BethlehemiteAnd it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soulAnd Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers houseThen Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soulAnd Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdleAnd David went out whithersoever Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and Saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Sauls servantsAnd it came to pass as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet king Saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musickAnd the women answered one another as they played and said Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousandsAnd Saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said They have ascribed unto David ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdomAnd Saul eyed David from that day and forwardAnd it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and David played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in Sauls handAnd Saul cast the javelin for he said I will smite David even to the wall with it And David avoided out of his presence twiceAnd Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him and was departed from SaulTherefore Saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the peopleAnd David behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the LORD was with himWherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of himBut all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before themAnd Saul said to David Behold my elder daughter Merab her will I give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the LORDs battles For Saul said Let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the Philistines be upon himAnd David said unto Saul Who am I and what is my life or my fathers family in Israel that I should be son in law to the kingBut it came to pass at the time when Merab Sauls daughter should have been given to David that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wifeAnd Michal Sauls daughter loved David and they told Saul and the thing pleased himAnd Saul said I will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him Wherefore Saul said to David Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twainAnd Saul commanded his servants saying Commune with David secretly and say Behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the kings son in lawAnd Sauls servants spake those words in the ears of David And David said Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings son in law seeing that I am a poor man and lightly esteemedAnd the servants of Saul told him saying On this manner spake DavidAnd Saul said Thus shall ye say to David The king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the PhilistinesAnd when his servants told David these words it pleased David well to be the kings son in law and the days were not expiredWherefore David arose and went he and his men and slew of the Philistines two hundred men and David brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the kings son in law And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wifeAnd Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David and that Michal Sauls daughter loved himAnd Saul was yet the more afraid of David and Saul became Davids enemy continuallyThen the princes of the Philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul so that his name was much set byAnd Saul spake to Jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill DavidBut Jonathan Sauls son delighted much in David and Jonathan told David saying Saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore I pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyselfAnd I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and I will commune with my father of thee and what I see that I will tell theeAnd Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father and said unto him Let not the king sin against his servant against David because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very goodFor he did put his life in his hand and slew the Philistine and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay David without a causeAnd Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan and Saul sware As the LORD liveth he shall not be slainAnd Jonathan called David and Jonathan shewed him all those things And Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was in his presence as in times pastAnd there was war again and David went out and fought with the Philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from himAnd the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and David played with his handAnd Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of Sauls presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and David fled and escaped that nightSaul also sent messengers unto Davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and Michal Davids wife told him saying If thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slainSo Michal let David down through a window and he went and fled and escapedAnd Michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a clothAnd when Saul sent messengers to take David she said He is sickAnd Saul sent the messengers again to see David saying Bring him up to me in the bed that I may slay himAnd when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolsterAnd Saul said unto Michal Why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped And Michal answered Saul He said unto me Let me go why should I kill theeSo David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him And he and Samuel went and dwelt in NaiothAnd it was told Saul saying Behold David is at Naioth in RamahAnd Saul sent messengers to take David and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as appointed over them the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul and they also prophesiedAnd when it was told Saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise And Saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied alsoThen went he also to Ramah and came to a great well that is in Sechu and he asked and said Where are Samuel and David And one said Behold they be at Naioth in RamahAnd he went thither to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in RamahAnd he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night Wherefore they say Is Saul also among the prophetsAnd David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan What have I done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my lifeAnd he said unto him God forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not soAnd David sware moreover and said Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes and he saith Let not Jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and deathThen said Jonathan unto David Whatsoever thy soul desireth I will even do it for theeAnd David said unto Jonathan Behold to morrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at evenIf thy father at all miss me then say David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the familyIf he say thus It is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by himTherefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy fatherAnd Jonathan said Far be it from thee for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not I tell it theeThen said David to Jonathan Who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughlyAnd Jonathan said unto David Come and let us go out into the field And they went out both of them into the fieldAnd Jonathan said unto David O LORD God of Israel when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward David and I then send not unto thee and shew it theeThe LORD do so and much more to Jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then I will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the LORD be with thee as he hath been with my fatherAnd thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD that I die notBut also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earthSo Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying Let the LORD even require it at the hand of Davids enemiesAnd Jonathan caused David to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soulThen Jonathan said to David To morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be emptyAnd when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone EzelAnd I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though I shot at a markAnd behold I will send a lad saying Go find out the arrows If I expressly say unto the lad Behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the LORD livethBut if I say thus unto the young man Behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the LORD hath sent thee awayAnd as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of behold the LORD be between thee and me for everSo David hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meatAnd the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and Jonathan arose and Abner sat by Sauls side and Davids place was emptyNevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day for he thought Something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not cleanAnd it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that Davids place was empty and Saul said unto Jonathan his son Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to dayAnd Jonathan answered Saul David earnestly asked leave of me to go to BethlehemAnd he said Let me go I pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if I have found favour in thine eyes let me get away I pray thee and see my brethren Therefore he cometh not unto the kings tableThen Sauls anger was kindled against Jonathan and he said unto him Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mothers nakednessFor as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely dieAnd Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him Wherefore shall he be slain what hath he doneAnd Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay DavidSo Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for David because his father had done him shameAnd it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David and a little lad with himAnd he said unto his lad Run find out now the arrows which I shoot And as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond himAnd when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot Jonathan cried after the lad and said Is not the arrow beyond theeAnd Jonathan cried after the lad Make speed haste stay not And Jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and came to his masterBut the lad knew not any thing only Jonathan and David knew the matterAnd Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him Go carry them to the cityAnd as soon as the lad was gone David arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until David exceededAnd Jonathan said to David Go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD saying The LORD be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever And he arose and departed and Jonathan went into the cityThen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David and said unto him Why art thou alone and no man with theeAnd David said unto Ahimelech the priest The king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee and what I have commanded thee and I have appointed my servants to such and such a placeNow therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is presentAnd the priest answered David and said There is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from womenAnd David answered the priest and said unto him Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vesselSo the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the LORD to put hot bread in the day when it was taken awayNow a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day detained before the LORD and his name was Doeg an Edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to SaulAnd David said unto Ahimelech And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required hasteAnd the priest said The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here And David said There is none like that give it meAnd David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul and went to Achish the king of GathAnd the servants of Achish said unto him Is not this David the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousandsAnd David laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of Achish the king of GathAnd he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beardThen said Achish unto his servants Lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to meHave I need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my houseDavid therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave Adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to himAnd every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred menAnd David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab and he said unto the king of Moab Let my father and my mother I pray thee come forth and be with you till I know what God will do for meAnd he brought them before the king of Moab and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the holdAnd the prophet Gad said unto David Abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of Judah Then David departed and came into the forest of HarethWhen Saul heard that David was discovered and the men that were with him now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about himThen Saul said unto his servants that stood about him Hear now ye Benjamites will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundredsThat all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this dayThen answered Doeg the Edomite which was set over the servants of Saul and said I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech the son of AhitubAnd he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of Goliath the PhilistineThen the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest the son of Ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in Nob and they came all of them to the kingAnd Saul said Hear now thou son of Ahitub And he answered Here I am my lordAnd Saul said unto him Why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of Jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast inquired of God for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this dayThen Ahimelech answered the king and said And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David which is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine houseDid I then begin to inquire of God for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing un to his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or moreAnd the king said Thou shalt surely die Ahimelech thou and all thy fathers houseAnd the king said unto the footmen that stood about him Turn and slay the priests of the LORD because their hand also is with David and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORDAnd the king said to Doeg Turn thou and fall upon the priests And Doeg the Edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephodAnd Nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the swordAnd one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub named Abiathar escaped and fled after DavidAnd Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORDs priestsAnd David said unto Abiathar I knew it that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would surely tell Saul I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers houseAbide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguardThen they told David saying Behold the Philistines fight against Keilah and they rob the threshingfloorsTherefore David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go and smite these Philistines And the LORD said unto David Go and smite the Philistines and save KeilahAnd Davids men said unto him Behold we be afraid here in Judah how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the PhilistinesThen David inquired of the LORD yet again And the LORD answered him and said Arise go down to Keilah for I will deliver the Philistines into thine handSo David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter So David saved the inhabitants of KeilahAnd it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah that he came down with an ephod in his handAnd it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah And Saul said God hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and barsAnd Saul called all the people together to war to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his menAnd David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to Abiathar the priest Bring hither the ephodThen said David O LORD God of Israel thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sakeWill the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard O LORD God of Israel I beseech thee tell thy servant And the LORD said He will come downThen said David Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul And the LORD said They will deliver thee upThen David and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of Keilah and went whithersoever they could go And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah and he forbare to go forthAnd David abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph And Saul sought him every day but God delivered him not into his handAnd David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a woodAnd Jonathan Sauls son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in GodAnd he said unto him Fear not for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over Israel and I shall be next unto thee and that also Saul my father knowethAnd they two made a covenant before the LORD and David abode in the wood and Jonathan went to his houseThen came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah saying Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of Hachilah which is on the south of JeshimonNow therefore O king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the kings handAnd Saul said Blessed be ye of the LORD for ye have compassion on meGo I pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtillySee therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and I will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of JudahAnd they arose and went to Ziph before Saul but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the plain on the south of JeshimonSaul also and his men went to seek him And they told David wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of Maon And when Saul heard that he pursued after David in the wilderness of MaonAnd Saul went on this side of the mountain and David and his men on that side of the mountain and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take themBut there came a messenger unto Saul saying Haste thee and come for the Philistines have invaded the landWherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekothAnd David went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at En-gediAnd it came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines that it was told him saying Behold David is in the wilderness of En-gediThen Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goatsAnd he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and Saul went in to cover his feet and David and his men remained in the sides of the caveAnd the men of David said unto him Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee Behold I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Sauls robe privilyAnd it came to pass afterward that Davids heart smote him because he had cut off Sauls skirtAnd he said unto his men The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the LORDs anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the LORDSo David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against Saul But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his wayDavid also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after Saul saying My lord the king And when Saul looked behind him David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himselfAnd David said to Saul Wherefore hearest thou mens words saying Behold David seeketh thy hurtBehold this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and I said I will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the LORDs anointedMoreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and I have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take itThe LORD judge between me and thee and the LORD avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon theeAs saith the proverb of the ancients Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon theeAfter whom is the king of Israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a fleaThe LORD therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine handAnd it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul that Saul said Is this thy voice my son David And Saul lifted up his voice and weptAnd he said to David Thou art more righteous than I for thou hast rewarded me good whereas I have rewarded thee evilAnd thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me notFor if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this dayAnd now behold I know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine handSwear now therefore unto me by the LORD that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers houseAnd David sware unto Saul And Saul went home but David and his men gat them up unto the holdAnd Samuel died and all the Israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at Ramah And David arose and went down to the wilderness of ParanAnd there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in CarmelNow the name of the man was Nabal and the name of his wife Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of CalebAnd David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheepAnd David sent out ten young men and David said unto the young men Get you up to Carmel and go to Nabal and greet him in my nameAnd thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity Peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hastAnd now I have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in CarmelAsk thy young men and they will shew thee Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give I pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son DavidAnd when Davids young men came they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David and ceasedAnd Nabal answered Davids servants and said Who is David and who is the son of Jesse there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his masterShall I then take my bread and my water and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom I know not whence they beSo Davids young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayingsAnd David said unto his men Gird ye on every man his sword And they girded on every man his sword and David also girded on his sword and there went up after David about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuffBut one of the young men told Abigail Nabals wife saying Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on themBut the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fieldsThey were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheepNow therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of Belial that a man cannot speak to himThen Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on assesAnd she said unto her servants Go on before me behold I come after you But she told not her husband NabalAnd it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert of the hill and behold David and his men came down against her and she met themNow David had said Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for goodSo and more also do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wallAnd when Abigail saw David she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the groundAnd fell at his feet and said Upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid I pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaidLet not my lord I pray thee regard this man of Belial even Nabal for as his name is so is he Nabal is his name and folly is with him but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst sendNow therefore my lord as the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as NabalAnd now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lordI pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD and evil hath not been found in thee all thy daysYet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a slingAnd it shall come to pass when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over IsraelThat this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaidAnd David said to Abigail Blessed be the LORD God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet meAnd blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own handFor in very deed as the LORD God of Israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wallSo David received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her Go up in peace to thine house see I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy personAnd Abigail came to Nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and Nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning lightBut it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stoneAnd it came to pass about ten days after that the LORD smote Nabal that he diedAnd when David heard that Nabal was dead he said Blessed be the LORD that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head And David sent and communed with Abigail to take her to him to wifeAnd when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel they spake unto her saying David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wifeAnd she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said Behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lordAnd Abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of David and became his wifeDavid also took Ahinoam of Jezreel and they were also both of them his wivesBut Saul had given Michal his daughter Davids wife to Phalti the son of Laish which was of GallimAnd the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah saying Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah which is before JeshimonThen Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him to seek David in the wilderness of ZiphAnd Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah which is before Jeshimon by the way But David abode in the wilderness and he saw that Saul came after him into the wildernessDavid therefore sent out spies and understood that Saul was come in very deedAnd David arose and came to the place where Saul had pitched and David beheld the place where Saul lay and Abner the son of Ner the captain of his host and Saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about himThen answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah brother to Joab saying Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp And Abishai said I will go down with theeSo David and Abishai came to the people by night and behold Saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but Abner and the people lay round about himThen said Abishai to David God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him I pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and I will not smite him the second timeAnd David said to Abishai Destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORDs anointed and be guiltlessDavid said furthermore As the LORD liveth the LORD shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perishThe LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORDs anointed but I pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us goSo David took the spear and the cruse of water from Sauls bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon themThen David went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between themAnd David cried to the people and to Abner the son of Ner saying Answerest thou not Abner Then Abner answered and said Who art thou that criest to the kingAnd David said to Abner Art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in Israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lordThis thing is not good that thou hast done As the LORD liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the LORDs anointed And now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolsterAnd Saul knew Davids voice and said Is this thy voice my son David And David said It is my voice my lord O kingAnd he said Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have I done or what evil is in mine handNow therefore I pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant If the LORD have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the LORD for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD saying Go serve other godsNow therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountainsThen said Saul I have sinned return my son David for I will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold I have played the fool and have erred exceedinglyAnd David answered and said Behold the kings spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch itThe LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORDs anointedAnd behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD and let him deliver me out of all tribulationThen Saul said to David Blessed be thou my son David thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail So David went on his way and Saul returned to his placeAnd David said in his heart I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines and Saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of Israel so shall I escape out of his handAnd David arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish the son of Maoch king of GathAnd David dwelt with Achish at Gath he and his men every man with his household even David with his two wives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabals wifeAnd it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath and he sought no more again for himAnd David said unto Achish If I have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that I may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with theeThen Achish gave him Ziklag that day wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this dayAnd the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four monthsAnd David and his men went up and invaded the Geshurites and the Gezrites and the Amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to Shur even unto the land of EgyptAnd David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to AchishAnd Achish said Whither have ye made a road to day And David said Against the south of Judah and against the south of the Jerahmeelites and against the south of the KenitesAnd David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath saying Lest they should tell on us saying So did David and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the PhilistinesAnd Achish believed David saying He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for everAnd it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with Israel And Achish said unto David Know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy menAnd David said to Achish Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do And Achish said to David Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for everNow Samuel was dead and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah even in his own city And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the landAnd the Philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in Shunem and Saul gathered all Israel together and they pitched in GilboaAnd when Saul saw the host of the Philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembledAnd when Saul inquired of the LORD the LORD answered him not neither by dreams nor by Urim nor by prophetsThen said Saul unto his servants Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that I may go to her and inquire of her And his servants said to him Behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at EndorAnd Saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said I pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom I shall name unto theeAnd the woman said unto him Behold thou knowest what Saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to dieAnd Saul sware to her by the LORD saying As the LORD liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thingThen said the woman Whom shall I bring up unto thee And he said Bring me up SamuelAnd when the woman saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to Saul saying Why hast thou deceived me for thou art SaulAnd the king said unto her Be not afraid for what sawest thou And the woman said unto Saul I saw gods ascending out of the earthAnd he said unto her What form is he of And she said An old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle And Saul perceived that it was Samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himselfAnd Samuel said to Saul Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up And Saul answered I am sore distressed for the Philistines make war against me and God is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore I have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall doThen said Samuel Wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the LORD is departed from thee and is become thine enemyAnd the LORD hath done to him as he spake by me for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to DavidBecause thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this dayMoreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the PhilistinesThen Saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the nightAnd the woman came unto Saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him Behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and I have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto meNow therefore I pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy wayBut he refused and said I will not eat But his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice So he arose from the earth and sat upon the bedAnd the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereofAnd she brought it before Saul and before his servants and they did eat Then they rose up and went away that nightNow the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in JezreelAnd the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but David and his men passed on in the rereward with AchishThen said the princes of the Philistines What do these Hebrews here And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines Is not this David the servant of Saul the king of Israel which hath been with me these days or these years and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this dayAnd the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the Philistines said unto him Make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these menIs not this David of whom they sang one to another in dances saying Saul slew his thousands and David his ten thousandsThen Achish called David and said unto him Surely as the LORD liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee notWherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the PhilistinesAnd David said unto Achish But what have I done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the kingAnd Achish answered and said to David I know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of God notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said He shall not go up with us to the battleWherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy masters servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light departSo David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the Philistines And the Philistines went up to JezreelAnd it came to pass when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the south and Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fireAnd had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their waySo David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captivesThen David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weepAnd Davids two wives were taken captives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the wife of Nabal the CarmeliteAnd David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the LORD his GodAnd David said to Abiathar the priest Ahimelechs son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to DavidAnd David inquired at the LORD saying Shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them And he answered him Pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover allSo David went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook Besor where those that were left behind stayedBut David pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook BesorAnd they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink waterAnd they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nightsAnd David said unto him To whom belongest thou and whence art thou And he said I am a young man of Egypt servant to an Amalekite and my master left me because three days agone I fell sickWe made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah and upon the south of Caleb and we burned Ziklag with fireAnd David said to him Canst thou bring me down to this company And he said Swear unto me by God that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and I will bring thee down to this companyAnd when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of JudahAnd David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fledAnd David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wivesAnd there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them David recovered allAnd David took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said This is Davids spoilAnd David came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow David whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him and when David came near to the people he saluted themThen answered all the wicked men and men of Belial of those that went with David and said Because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and departThen said David Ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the LORD hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our handFor who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alikeAnd it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this dayAnd when David came to Ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah even to his friends saying Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORDTo them which were in Bethel and to them which were in south Ramoth and to them which were in JattirAnd to them which were in Aroer and to them which were in Siphmoth and to them which were in EshtemoaAnd to them which were in Rachal and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the KenitesAnd to them which were in Hormah and to them which were in Chor-ashan and to them which were in AthachAnd to them which were in Hebron and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to hauntNow the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in mount GilboaAnd the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua Sauls sonsAnd the battle went sore against Saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archersThen said Saul unto his armourbearer Draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me But his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid Therefore Saul took a sword and fell upon itAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with himSo Saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day togetherAnd when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side Jordan saw that the men of Israel fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the Philistines came and dwelt in themAnd it came to pass on the morrow when the Philistines came to strip the slain that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount GilboaAnd they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the peopleAnd they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shanAnd when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to SaulAll the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan and came to Jabesh and burnt them thereAnd they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh and fasted seven daysNow it came to pass after the death of Saul when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and David had abode two days in ZiklagIt came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to David that he fell to the earth and did obeisanceAnd David said unto him From whence comest thou And he said unto him Out of the camp of Israel am I escapedAnd David said unto him How went the matter I pray thee tell me And he answered That the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead alsoAnd David said unto the young man that told him How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be deadAnd the young man that told him said As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa behold Saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after himAnd when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me And I answered Here am IAnd he said unto me Who art thou And I answered him I am an AmalekiteAnd he said unto me again Stand I pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in meSo I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lordThen David took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with himAnd they mourned and wept and fasted until even for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel because they were fallen by the swordAnd David said unto the young man that told him Whence art thou And he answered I am the son of a stranger an AmalekiteAnd David said unto him How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORDs anointedAnd David called one of the young men and said Go near and fall upon him And he smote him that he diedAnd David said unto him Thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying I have slain the LORDs anointedAnd David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his sonAlso he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of JasherThe beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallenTell it not in Gath publish it not in the streets of Askelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumphYe mountains of Gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oilFrom the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back and the sword of Saul returned not emptySaul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lionsYe daughters of Israel weep over Saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparelHow are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle O Jonathan thou was slain in thine high placesI am distressed for thee my brother Jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of womenHow are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perishedAnd it came to pass after this that David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah And the LORD said unto him Go up And David said Whither shall I go up And he said Unto HebronSo David went up thither and his two wives also Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail Nabals wife the CarmeliteAnd his men that were with him did David bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of HebronAnd the men of Judah came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah And they told David saying That the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried SaulAnd David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead and said unto them Blessed be ye of the LORD that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto Saul and have buried himAnd now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you and I also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thingTherefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master Saul is dead and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over themBut Abner the son of Ner captain of Sauls host took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to MahanaimAnd made him king over Gilead and over the Ashurites and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over all IsraelIsh-bosheth Sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel and reigned two years But the house of Judah followed DavidAnd the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six monthsAnd Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to GibeonAnd Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met together by the pool of Gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the poolAnd Abner said to Joab Let the young men now arise and play before us And Joab said Let them ariseThen there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and twelve of the servants of DavidAnd they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim which is in GibeonAnd there was a very sore battle that day and Abner was beaten and the men of Israel before the servants of DavidAnd there were three sons of Zeruiah there Joab and Abishai and Asahel and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roeAnd Asahel pursued after Abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following AbnerThen Abner looked behind him and said Art thou Asahel And he answered I amAnd Abner said to him Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour But Asahel would not turn aside from following of himAnd Abner said again to Asahel Turn thee aside from following me wherefore should I smite thee to the ground how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brotherHowbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood stillJoab also and Abishai pursued after Abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of GibeonAnd the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hillThen Abner called to Joab and said Shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethrenAnd Joab said As God liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brotherSo Joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after Israel no more neither fought they any moreAnd Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over Jordan and went through all Bithron and they came to MahanaimAnd Joab returned from following Abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of Davids servants nineteen men and AsahelBut the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin and of Abners men so that three hundred and threescore men diedAnd they took up Asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in Bethlehem And Joab and his men went all night and they came to Hebron at break of dayNow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David but David waxed stronger and stronger and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weakerAnd unto David were sons born in Hebron and his firstborn was Amnon of Ahinoam the JezreelitessAnd his second Chileab of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite and the third Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of GeshurAnd the fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith and the fifth Shephatiah the son of AbitalAnd the sixth Ithream by Eglah Davids wife These were born to David in HebronAnd it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner made himself strong for the house of SaulAnd Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah and Ish-bosheth said to Abner Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubineThen was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth and said Am I a dogs head which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of David that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this womanSo do God to Abner and more also except as the LORD hath sworn to David even so I do to himTo translate the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan even to Beer-shebaAnd he could not answer Abner a word again because he feared himAnd Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf saying Whose is the land saying also Make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto theeAnd he said Well I will make a league with thee but one thing I require of thee that is Thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou comest to see my faceAnd David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Sauls son saying Deliver me my wife Michal which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the PhilistinesAnd Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband even from Phaltiel the son of LaishAnd her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim Then said Abner unto him Go return And he returnedAnd Abner had communication with the elders of Israel saying Ye sought for David in times past to be king over youNow then do it for the LORD hath spoken of David saying By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemiesAnd Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of BenjaminSo Abner came to David to Hebron and twenty men with him And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feastAnd Abner said unto David I will arise and go and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth And David sent Abner away and he went in peaceAnd Behold the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but Abner was not with David in Hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peaceWhen Joab and all the host that was with him were come they told Joab saying Abner the son of Ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peaceThen Joab came to the king and said What hast thou done behold Abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite goneThou knowest Abner the son of Ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doestAnd when Joab was come out from David he sent messengers after Abner which brought him again from the well of Sirah but David knew it notAnd when Abner was returned to Hebron Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of Asahel his brotherAnd afterward when David heard it he said I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of NerLet it rest on the head of Joab and on all his fathers house and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh breadSo Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battleAnd David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him Rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before Abner And king David himself followed the bierAnd they buried Abner in Hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people weptAnd the king lamented over Abner and said Died Abner as a fool diethThy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou And all the people wept again over himAnd when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day David sware saying So do God to me and more also if I taste bread or ought else till the sun be downAnd all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the peopleFor all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of NerAnd the king said unto his servants Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in IsraelAnd I am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickednessAnd when Sauls son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron his hands were feeble and all the Israelites were troubledAnd Sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite of the children of Benjamin for Beeroth also was reckoned to BenjaminAnd the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and were sojourners there until this dayAnd Jonathan Sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame And his name was MephiboshethAnd the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite Rechab and Baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth who lay on a bed at noonAnd they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and Rechab and Baanah his brother escapedFor when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all nightAnd they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron and said to the king Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seedAnd David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite and said unto them As the LORD liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversityWhen one told me saying Behold Saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings I took hold of him and slew him in Ziklag who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidingsHow much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earthAnd David commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in HebronThen came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron and spake saying Behold we are thy bone and thy fleshAlso in time past when Saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel and the LORD said to thee Thou shalt feed my people Israel and thou shalt be a captain over IsraelSo all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD and they anointed David king over IsraelDavid was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty yearsIn Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and JudahAnd the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto David saying Except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking David cannot come in hitherNevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion the same is the city of DavidAnd David said on that day Whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of Davids soul he shall be chief and captain Wherefore they said The blind and the lame shall not come into the houseSo David dwelt in the fort and called it the city of David And David built round about from Millo and inwardAnd David went on and grew great and the LORD God of hosts was with himAnd Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built David an houseAnd David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israels sakeAnd David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he was come from Hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to DavidAnd these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and SolomonIbhar also and Elishua and Nepheg and JaphiaAnd Elishama and Eliada and EliphaletBut when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David and David heard of it and went down to the holdThe Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of RephaimAnd David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go up to the Philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand And the LORD said unto David Go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine handAnd David came to Baal-perazim and David smote them there and said The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazimAnd there they left their images and David and his men burned themAnd the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of RephaimAnd when David inquired of the LORD he said Thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry treesAnd let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the LORD go out before thee to smite the host of the PhilistinesAnd David did so as the LORD had commanded him and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to GazerAgain David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel thirty thousandAnd David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubimsAnd they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab drave the new cartAnd they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah accompanying the ark of God and Ahio went before the arkAnd David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbalsAnd when they came to Nachons threshingfloor Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen shook itAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah and God smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of GodAnd David was displeased because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this dayAnd David was afraid of the LORD that day and said How shall the ark of the LORD come to meSo David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the GittiteAnd the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his householdAnd it was told king David saying The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of God So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladnessAnd it was so that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlingsAnd David danced before the LORD with all his might and David was girded with a linen ephodSo David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the trumpetAnd as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David Michal Sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD and she despised him in her heartAnd they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORDAnd as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hostsAnd he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of Israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine So all the people departed every one to his houseThen David returned to bless his household And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said How glorious was the king of Israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himselfAnd David said unto Michal It was before the LORD which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD over Israel therefore will I play before the LORDAnd I will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall I be had in honourTherefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her deathAnd it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemiesThat the king said unto Nathan the prophet See now I dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of God dwelleth within curtainsAnd Nathan said to the king Go do all that is in thine heart for the LORD is with theeAnd it came to pass that night that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan sayingGo and tell my servant David Thus saith the LORD Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell inWhereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacleIn all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people Israel saying Why build ye not me an house of cedarNow therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David Thus saith the LORD of hosts I took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over IsraelAnd I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earthMoreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetimeAnd as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an houseAnd when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdomHe shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for everI will be his father and he shall be my son If he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of menBut my mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before theeAnd thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for everAccording to all these words and according to all this vision so did Nathan speak unto DavidThen went king David in and sat before the LORD and he said Who am I O Lord GOD and what is my house that thou hast brought me hithertoAnd this was yet a small thing in thy sight O Lord GOD but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come And is this the manner of man O Lord GODAnd what can David say more unto thee for thou Lord GOD knowest thy servantFor thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know themWherefore thou art great O LORD God for there is none like thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our earsAnd what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like Israel whom God went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt from the nations and their godsFor thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou LORD art become their GodAnd now O LORD God the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast saidAnd let thy name be magnified for ever saying The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel and let the house of thy servant David be established before theeFor thou O LORD of hosts God of Israel hast revealed to thy servant saying I will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto theeAnd now O Lord GOD thou art that God and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servantTherefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou O Lord GOD hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for everAnd after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the PhilistinesAnd he smote Moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive And so the Moabites became Davids servants and brought giftsDavid smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah as he went to recover his border at the river EuphratesAnd David took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and David houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariotsAnd when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand menThen David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus and the Syrians became servants to David and brought gifts And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he wentAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to JerusalemAnd from Betah and from Berothai cities of Hadadezer king David took exceeding much brassWhen Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of HadadezerThen Toi sent Joram his son unto king David to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him for Hadadezer had wars with Toi And Joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brassWhich also king David did dedicate unto the LORD with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subduedOf Syria and of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philistines and of Amalek and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of ZobahAnd David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand menAnd he put garrisons in Edom throughout all Edom put he garrisons and all they of Edom became Davids servants And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he wentAnd David reigned over all Israel and David executed judgment and justice unto all his peopleAnd Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorderAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests and Seraiah was the scribeAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites and Davids sons were chief rulersAnd David said Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul that I may shew him kindness for Jonathans sakeAnd there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba And when they had called him unto David the king said unto him Art thou Ziba And he said Thy servant is heAnd the king said Is there not yet any of the house of Saul that I may shew the kindness of God unto him And Ziba said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feetAnd the king said unto him Where is he And Ziba said unto the king Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debarThen king David sent and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debarNow when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come unto David he fell on his face and did reverence And David said Mephibosheth And he answered Behold thy servantAnd David said unto him Fear not for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continuallyAnd he bowed himself and said What is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I amThen the king called to Ziba Sauls servant and said unto him I have given unto thy masters son all that pertained to Saul and to all his houseThou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have food to eat but Mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servantsThen said Ziba unto the king According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do As for Mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sonsAnd Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto MephiboshethSo Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and was lame on both his feetAnd it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died and Hanun his son reigned in his steadThen said David I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father And Davids servants came into the land of the children of AmmonAnd the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow itWherefore Hanun took Davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them awayWhen they told it unto David he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown and then returnAnd when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob and the Syrians of Zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king Maacah a thousand men and of Ish-tob twelve thousand menAnd when David heard of it he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty menAnd the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob and Ish-tob and Maacah were by themselves in the fieldWhen Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of Israel and put them in array against the SyriansAnd the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of AmmonAnd he said If the Syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee then I will come and help theeBe of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our God and the LORD do that which seemeth him goodAnd Joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the Syrians and they fled before himAnd when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled then fled they also before Abishai and entered into the city So Joab returned from the children of Ammon and came to JerusalemAnd when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel they gathered themselves togetherAnd Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river and they came to Helam and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before themAnd when it was told David he gathered all Israel together and passed over Jordan and came to Helam And the Syrians set themselves in array against David and fought with himAnd the Syrians fled before Israel and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote Shobach the captain of their host who died thereAnd when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel they made peace with Israel and served them So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any moreAnd it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Rabbah But David tarried still at JerusalemAnd it came to pass in an eveningtide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look uponAnd David sent and inquired after the woman And one said Is not this Bath-sheba the daughter of Eliam the wife of Uriah the HittiteAnd David sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her houseAnd the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with childAnd David sent to Joab saying Send me Uriah the Hittite And Joab sent Uriah to DavidAnd when Uriah was come unto him David demanded of him how Joab did and how the people did and how the war prosperedAnd David said to Uriah Go down to thy house and wash thy feet And Uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess of meat from the kingBut Uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his houseAnd when they had told David saying Uriah went not down unto his house David said unto Uriah Camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine houseAnd Uriah said unto David The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall I then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth I will not do this thingAnd David said to Uriah Tarry here to day also and to morrow I will let thee depart So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrowAnd when David had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his houseAnd it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of UriahAnd he wrote in the letter saying Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and dieAnd it came to pass when Joab observed the city that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men wereAnd the men of the city went out and fought with Joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of David and Uriah the Hittite died alsoThen Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the warAnd charged the messenger saying When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the kingAnd if so be that the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wallWho smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in Thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead alsoSo the messenger went and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him forAnd the messenger said unto David Surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gateAnd the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead alsoThen David said unto the messenger Thus shalt thou say unto Joab Let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou himAnd when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husbandAnd when the mourning was past David sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son But the thing that David had done displeased the LORDAnd the LORD sent Nathan unto David And he came unto him and said unto him There were two men in one city the one rich and the other poorThe rich man had exceeding many flocks and herdsBut the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughterAnd there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to himAnd Davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan As the LORD liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely dieAnd he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pityAnd Nathan said to David Thou art the man Thus saith the LORD God of Israel I anointed thee king over Israel and I delivered thee out of the hand of SaulAnd I gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would moreover have given unto thee such and such thingsWherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD to do evil in his sight thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of AmmonNow therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wifeThus saith the LORD Behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sunFor thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sunAnd David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the LORD And Nathan said unto David The LORD also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not dieHowbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely dieAnd Nathan departed unto his house And the LORD struck the child that Uriahs wife bare unto David and it was very sickDavid therefore besought God for the child and David fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earthAnd the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with themAnd it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said Behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is deadBut when David saw that his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead therefore David said unto his servants Is the child dead And they said He is deadThen David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the LORD and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eatThen said his servants unto him What thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat breadAnd he said While the child was yet alive I fasted and wept for I said Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me that the child may liveBut now he is dead wherefore should I fast can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to meAnd David comforted Bath-sheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name Solomon and the LORD loved himAnd he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his name Jedidiah because of the LORDAnd Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon and took the royal cityAnd Joab sent messengers to David and said I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the city of watersNow therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest I take the city and it be called after my nameAnd David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took itAnd he took their kings crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on Davids head And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundanceAnd he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon So David and all the people returned unto JerusalemAnd it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and Amnon the son of David loved herAnd Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to herBut Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother and Jonadab was a very subtil manAnd he said unto him Why art thou being the kings son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me And Amnon said unto him I love Tamar my brother Absaloms sisterAnd Jonadab said unto him Lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him I pray thee let my sister Tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her handSo Amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him Amnon said unto the king I pray thee let Tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her handThen David sent home to Tamar saying Go now to thy brother Amnons house and dress him meatSo Tamar went to her brother Amnons house and he was laid down And she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakesAnd she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat And Amnon said Have out all men from me And they went out every man from himAnd Amnon said unto Tamar Bring the meat into the chamber that I may eat of thine hand And Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brotherAnd when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her Come lie with me my sisterAnd she answered him Nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in Israel do not thou this follyAnd I whither shall I cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel Now therefore I pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from theeHowbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with herThen Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her And Amnon said unto her Arise be goneAnd she said unto him There is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me But he would not hearken unto herThen he called his servant that ministered unto him and said Put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after herAnd she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after herAnd Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on cryingAnd Absalom her brother said unto her Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms houseBut when king David heard of all these things he was very wrothAnd Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister TamarAnd it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor which is beside Ephraim and Absalom invited all the kings sonsAnd Absalom came to the king and said Behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king I beseech thee and his servants go with thy servantAnd the king said to Absalom Nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee And he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed himThen said Absalom If not I pray thee let my brother Amnon go with us And the king said unto him Why should he go with theeBut Absalom pressed him that he let Amnon and all the kings sons go with himNow Absalom had commanded his servants saying Mark ye now when Amnons heart is merry with wine and when I say unto you Smite Amnon then kill him fear not have not I commanded you be courageous and be valiantAnd the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded Then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fledAnd it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to David saying Absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them leftThen the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rentAnd Jonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother answered and said Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the kings sons for Amnon only is dead for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister TamarNow therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for Amnon only is deadBut Absalom fled And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind himAnd Jonadab said unto the king Behold the kings sons come as thy servant said so it isAnd it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very soreBut Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud king of Geshur And David mourned for his son every daySo Absalom fled and went to Geshur and was there three yearsAnd the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom for he was comforted concerning Amnon seeing he was deadNow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward AbsalomAnd Joab sent to Tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her I pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the deadAnd come to the king and speak on this manner unto him So Joab put the words in her mouthAnd when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said Help O kingAnd the king said unto her What aileth thee And she answered I am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is deadAnd thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew himAnd behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said Deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earthAnd the king said unto the woman Go to thine house and I will give charge concerning theeAnd the woman of Tekoah said unto the king My lord O king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltlessAnd the king said Whosoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any moreThen said she I pray thee let the king remember the LORD thy God that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son And he said As the LORD liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earthThen the woman said Let thine handmaid I pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king And he said Say onAnd the woman said Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banishedFor we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth God respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from himNow therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said I will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaidFor the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of GodThen thine handmaid said The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of God so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the LORD thy God will be with theeThen the king answered and said unto the woman Hide not from me I pray thee the thing that I shall ask thee And the woman said Let my lord the king now speakAnd the king said Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this And the woman answered and said As thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant Joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaidTo fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of God to know all things that are in the earthAnd the king said unto Joab Behold now I have done this thing go therefore bring the young man Absalom againAnd Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and Joab said To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight my lord O king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servantSo Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to JerusalemAnd the king said Let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face So Absalom returned to his own house and saw not the kings faceBut in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in himAnd when he polled his head for it was at every years end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weightAnd unto Absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar she was a woman of a fair countenanceSo Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and saw not the kings faceTherefore Absalom sent for Joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not comeTherefore he said unto his servants See Joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire And Absaloms servants set the field on fireThen Joab arose and came to Absalom unto his house and said unto him Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fireAnd Absalom answered Joab Behold I sent unto thee saying Come hither that I may send thee to the king to say Wherefore am I come from Geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill meSo Joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for Absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed AbsalomAnd it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before himAnd Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then Absalom called unto him and said Of what city art thou And he said Thy servant is of one of the tribes of IsraelAnd Absalom said unto him See thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear theeAbsalom said moreover Oh that I were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and I would do him justiceAnd it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed himAnd on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of IsraelAnd it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said unto the king I pray thee let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto the LORD in HebronFor thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria saying If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then I will serve the LORDAnd the king said unto him Go in peace So he arose and went to HebronBut Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say Absalom reigneth in HebronAnd with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thingAnd Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Davids counseller from his city even from Giloh while he offered sacrifices And the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with AbsalomAnd there came a messenger to David saying The hearts of the men of Israel are after AbsalomAnd David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem Arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from Absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the swordAnd the kings servants said unto the king Behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appointAnd the king went forth and all his household after him And the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the houseAnd the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far offAnd all his servants passed on beside him and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites six hundred men which came after him from Gath passed on before the kingThen said the king to Ittai the Gittite Wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exileWhereas thou camest but yesterday should I this day make thee go up and down with us seeing I go whither I may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with theeAnd Ittai answered the king and said As the LORD liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant beAnd David said to Ittai Go and pass over And Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with himAnd all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wildernessAnd lo Zadok also and all the Levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God and they set down the ark of God and Abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the cityAnd the king said unto Zadok Carry back the ark of God into the city if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitationBut if he thus say I have no delight in thee behold here am I let him do to me as seemeth good unto himThe king said also unto Zadok the priest Art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you Ahimaaz thy son and Jonathan the son of AbiatharSee I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify meZadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem and they tarried thereAnd David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went upAnd one told David saying Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom And David said O LORD I pray thee turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishnessAnd it came to pass that when David was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped God behold Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his headUnto whom David said If thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto meBut if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom I will be thy servant O king as I have been thy fathers servant hitherto so will I now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of AhithophelAnd hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priestsBehold they have there with them their two sons Ahimaaz Zadoks son and Jonathan Abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hearSo Hushai Davids friend came into the city and Absalom came into JerusalemAnd when David was a little past the top of the hill behold Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wineAnd the king said unto Ziba What meanest thou by these And Ziba said The asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drinkAnd the king said And where is thy masters son And Ziba said unto the king Behold he abideth at Jerusalem for he said To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my fatherThen said the king to Ziba Behold thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth And Ziba said I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight my lord O kingAnd when king David came to Bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei the son of Gera he came forth and cursed still as he cameAnd he cast stones at David and at all the servants of king David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his leftAnd thus said Shimei when he cursed Come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of BelialThe LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody manThen said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his headAnd the king said What have I to do with you ye sons of Zeruiah so let him curse because the LORD hath said unto him Curse David Who shall then say Wherefore hast thou done soAnd David said to Abishai and to all his servants Behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this Benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the LORD hath bidden himIt may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this dayAnd as David and his men went by the way Shimei went along on the hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dustAnd the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves thereAnd Absalom and all the people the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel with himAnd it came to pass when Hushai the Archite Davids friend was come unto Absalom that Hushai said unto Absalom God save the king God save the kingAnd Absalom said to Hushai Is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friendAnd Hushai said unto Absalom Nay but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose his will I be and with him will I abideAnd again whom should I serve should I not serve in the presence of his son as I have served in thy fathers presence so will I be in thy presenceThen said Absalom to Ahithophel Give counsel among you what we shall doAnd Ahithophel said unto Absalom Go in unto thy fathers concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strongSo they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house and Absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all IsraelAnd the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with AbsalomMoreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom Let me now choose out twelve thousand men and I will arise and pursue after David this nightAnd I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and I will smite the king onlyAnd I will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peaceAnd the saying pleased Absalom well and all the elders of IsraelThen said Absalom Call now Hushai the Archite also and let us hear likewise what he saithAnd when Hushai was come to Absalom Absalom spake unto him saying Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thouAnd Hushai said unto Absalom The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this timeFor said Hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the peopleBehold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say There is a slaughter among the people that follow AbsalomAnd he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant menTherefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee from Dan even to Beer-sheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own personSo shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as oneMoreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found thereAnd Absalom and all the men of Israel said The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon AbsalomThen said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel and thus and thus have I counselledNow therefore send quickly and tell David saying Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with himNow Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king DavidNevertheless a lad saw them and told Absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in Bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went downAnd the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not knownAnd when Absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they said Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan And the woman said unto them They be gone over the brook of water And when they had sought and could not find them they returned to JerusalemAnd it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king David and said unto David Arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against youThen David arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over Jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over JordanAnd when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his fatherThen David came to Mahanaim And Absalom passed over Jordan he and all the men of Israel with himAnd Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab which Amasa was a mans son whose name was Ithra an Israelite that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash sister to Zeruiah Joabs motherSo Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of GileadAnd it came to pass when David was come to Mahanaim that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar and Barzillai the Gileadite of RogelimBrought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulseAnd honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for David and for the people that were with him to eat for they said The people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wildernessAnd David numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over themAnd David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah Joabs brother and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite And the king said unto the people I will surely go forth with you myself alsoBut the people answered Thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the cityAnd the king said unto them What seemeth you best I will do And the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousandsAnd the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai saying Deal gently for my sake with the young man even with Absalom And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning AbsalomSo the people went out into the field against Israel and the battle was in the wood of EphraimWhere the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand menFor the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devouredAnd Absalom met the servants of David And Absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went awayAnd a certain man saw it and told Joab and said Behold I saw Absalom hanged in an oakAnd Joab said unto the man that told him And behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdleAnd the man said unto Joab Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would I not put forth mine hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai saying Beware that none touch the young man AbsalomOtherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against meThen said Joab I may not tarry thus with thee And he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oakAnd ten young men that bare Joabs armour compassed about and smote Absalom and slew himAnd Joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after Israel for Joab held back the peopleAnd they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all Israel fled every one to his tentNow Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day Absaloms placeThen said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok Let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemiesAnd Joab said unto him Thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the kings son is deadThen said Joab to Cushi Go tell the king what thou hast seen And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab and ranThen said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab But howsoever let me I pray thee also run after Cushi And Joab said Wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings readyBut howsoever said he let me run And he said unto him Run Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran CushiAnd David sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running aloneAnd the watchman cried and told the king And the king said If he be alone there is tidings in his mouth And he came apace and drew nearAnd the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said Behold another man running alone And the king said He also bringeth tidingsAnd the watchman said Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok And the king said He is a good man and cometh with good tidingsAnd Ahimaaz called and said unto the king All is well And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said Blessed be the LORD thy God which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the kingAnd the king said Is the young man Absalom safe And Ahimaaz answered When Joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant I saw a great tumult but I knew not what it wasAnd the king said unto him Turn aside and stand here And he turned aside and stood stillAnd behold Cushi came and Cushi said Tidings my lord the king for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against theeAnd the king said unto Cushi Is the young man Absalom safe And Cushi answered The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man isAnd the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said O my son Absalom my son my son Absalom would God I had died for thee O Absalom my son my sonAnd it was told Joab Behold the king weepeth and mourneth for AbsalomAnd the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his sonAnd the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battleBut the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my sonAnd Joab came into the house to the king and said Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubinesIn that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends For thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee wellNow therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for I swear by the LORD if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until nowThen the king arose and sat in the gate And they told unto all the people saying Behold the king doth sit in the gate And all the people came before the king for Israel had fled every man to his tentAnd all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel saying The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines and now he is fled out of the land for AbsalomAnd Absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king backAnd king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying Speak unto the elders of Judah saying Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king even to his houseYe are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the kingAnd say ye to Amasa Art thou not of my bone and of my flesh God do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of JoabAnd he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king Return thou and all thy servantsSo the king returned and came to Jordan And Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over JordanAnd Shimei the son of Gera a Benjamite which was of Bahurim hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king DavidAnd there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over Jordan before the kingAnd there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings household and to do what he thought good And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was come over JordanAnd said unto the king Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to his heartFor thy servant doth know that I have sinned therefore behold I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the kingBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said Shall not Shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the LORDs anointedAnd David said What have I to do with you ye sons of Zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel for do not I know that I am this day king over IsraelTherefore the king said unto Shimei Thou shalt not die And the king sware unto himAnd Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peaceAnd it came to pass when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him Wherefore wentest not thou with me MephiboshethAnd he answered My lord O king my servant deceived me for thy servant said I will saddle me an ass that I may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lameAnd he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of God do therefore what is good in thine eyesFor all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the kingAnd the king said unto him Why speakest thou any more of thy matters I have said Thou and Ziba divide the landAnd Mephibosheth said unto the king Yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own houseAnd Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went over Jordan with the king to conduct him over JordanNow Barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim for he was a very great manAnd the king said unto Barzillai Come thou over with me and I will feed thee with me in JerusalemAnd Barzillai said unto the king How long have I to live that I should go up with the king unto JerusalemI am this day fourscore years old and can I discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the kingThy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a rewardLet thy servant I pray thee turn back again that I may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother But behold thy servant Chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto theeAnd the king answered Chimham shall go over with me and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will I do for theeAnd all the people went over Jordan And when the king was come over the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own placeThen the king went on to Gilgal and Chimham went on with him and all the people of Judah conducted the king and also half the people of IsraelAnd behold all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto the king Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all Davids men with him over JordanAnd all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel Because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings cost or hath he given us any giftAnd the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said We have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in David than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of IsraelAnd there happened to be there a man of Belial whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said We have no part in David neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse every man to his tents O IsraelSo every man of Israel went up from after David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri but the men of Judah clave unto their king from Jordan even to JerusalemAnd David came to his house at Jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them So they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhoodThen said the king to Amasa Assemble me the men of Judah within three days and be thou here presentSo Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed himAnd David said to Abishai Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape usAnd there went out after him Joabs men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of BichriWhen they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon Amasa went before them And Joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell outAnd Joab said to Amasa Art thou in health my brother And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss himBut Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of BichriAnd one of Joabs men stood by him and said He that favoureth Joab and he that is for David let him go after JoabAnd Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway And when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood stillWhen he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of BichriAnd he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel and to Beth-maachah and all the Berites and they were gathered together and went also after himAnd they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall to throw it downThen cried a wise woman out of the city Hear hear say I pray you unto Joab Come near hither that I may speak with theeAnd when he was come near unto her the woman said Art thou Joab And he answered I am he Then she said unto him Hear the words of thine handmaid And he answered I do hearThen she spake saying They were wont to speak in old time saying They shall surely ask counsel at Abel and so they ended the matterI am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORDAnd Joab answered and said Far be it far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroyThe matter is not so but a man of mount Ephraim Sheba the son of Bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against David deliver him only and I will depart from the city And the woman said unto Joab Behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wallThen the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and cast it out to Joab And he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the kingNow Joab was over all the host of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the PelethitesAnd Adoram was over the tribute and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorderAnd Sheva was scribe and Zadok and Abiathar were the priestsAnd Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about DavidThen there was a famine in the days of David three years year after year and David inquired of the LORD And the LORD answered It is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the GibeonitesAnd the king called the Gibeonites and said unto them now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites and the children of Israel had sworn unto them and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and JudahWherefore David said unto the Gibeonites What shall I do for you and wherewith shall I make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORDAnd the Gibeonites said unto him We will have no silver nor gold of Saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel And he said What ye shall say that will I do for youAnd they answered the king The man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of IsraelLet seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul whom the LORD did choose And the king said I will give themBut the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul because of the LORDs oath that was between them between David and Jonathan the son of SaulBut the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bare unto Saul Armoni and Mephibosheth and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the MeholathiteAnd he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvestAnd Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by nightAnd it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had doneAnd David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hanged them when the Philistines had slain Saul in GilboaAnd he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hangedAnd the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah in the sepulchre of Kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded And after that God was intreated for the landMoreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel and David went down and his servants with him and fought against the Philistines and David waxed faintAnd Ishbi-benob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain DavidBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him and smote the Philistine and killed him Then the men of David sware unto him saying Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of IsraelAnd it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph which was of the sons of the giantAnd there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beamAnd there was yet a battle in Gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giantAnd when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew himThese four were born to the giant in Gath and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servantsAnd David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of SaulAnd he said The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my delivererThe God of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violenceI will call on the LORD who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemiesWhen the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraidThe sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented meIn my distress I called upon the LORD and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his earsThen the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wrothThere went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by itHe bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feetAnd he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the windAnd he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skiesThrough the brightness before him were coals of fire kindledThe LORD thundered from heaven and the most High uttered his voiceAnd he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited themAnd the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the LORD at the blast of the breath of his nostrilsHe sent from above he took me he drew me out of many watersHe delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for meThey prevented me in the day of my calamity but the LORD was my stayHe brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in meThe LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed meFor I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my GodFor all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes I did not depart from themI was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquityTherefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sightWith the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself uprightWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavouryAnd the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them downFor thou art my lamp O LORD and the LORD will lighten my darknessFor by thee I have run through a troop by my God have I leaped over a wallAs for God his way is perfect the word of the LORD is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in himFor who is God save the LORD and who is a rock save our GodGod is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfectHe maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high placesHe teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine armsThou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me greatThou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slipI have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until I had consumed themAnd I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are fallen under my feetFor thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under meThou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that I might destroy them that hate meThey looked but there was none to save even unto the LORD but he answered them notThen did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth I did stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroadThou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which I knew not shall serve meStrangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto meStrangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close placesThe LORD liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvationIt is God that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people under meAnd that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent manTherefore I will give thanks unto thee O LORD among the heathen and I will sing praises unto thy nameHe is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto David and to his seed for evermoreNow these be the last words of David David the son of Jesse said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the God of Jacob and the sweet psalmist of Israel saidThe Spirit of the LORD spake by me and his word was in my tongueThe God of Israel said the Rock of Israel spake to me He that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of GodAnd he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rainAlthough my house be not so with God yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to growBut the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away because they cannot be taken with handsBut the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same placeThese be the names of the mighty men whom David had The Tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was Adino the Eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one timeAnd after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone awayHe arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the LORD wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoilAnd after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the PhilistinesBut he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the LORD wrought a great victoryAnd three of the thirty chief went down and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of RephaimAnd David was then in an hold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in BethlehemAnd David longed and said Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gateAnd the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the LORDAnd he said Be it far from me O LORD that I should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it These things did these three mighty menAnd Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief among three And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among threeWas he not most honourable of three therefore he was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first threeAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of Moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snowAnd he slew an Egyptian a goodly man and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand and slew him with his own spearThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and had the name among three mighty menHe was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three And David set him over his guardAsahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty Elhanan the son of Dodo of BethlehemShammah the Harodite Elika the HaroditeHelez the Paltite Ira the son of Ikkesh the TekoiteAbiezer the Anethothite Mebunnai the HushathiteZalmon the

Maachathite Eliam the son of Ahithophel the GiloniteHezrai the Carmelite Paarai the ArbiteIgal the son of Nathan of Zobah Bani the GaditeZelek the Ammonite Naharai the Beerothite armourbearer to Joab the son of ZeruiahIra an Ithrite Gareb an IthriteUriah the Hittite thirty and seven in allAnd again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say Go number Israel and JudahFor the king said to Joab the captain of the host which was with him Go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba and number ye the people that I may know the number of the peopleAnd Joab said unto the king Now the LORD thy God add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thingNotwithstanding the kings word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of IsraelAnd they passed over Jordan and pitched in Aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad and toward JazerThen they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi and they came to Dan-jaan and about to ZidonAnd came to the strong hold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hibites and of the Canaanites and they went out to the south of Judah even to Beer-shebaSo when they had gone through all the land they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty daysAnd Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand menAnd Davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people And David said unto the LORD I have sinned greatly in that I have done and now I beseech thee O LORD take away the iniquity of thy servant for I have done very foolishlyFor when David was up in the morning the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad Davids seer sayingGo and say unto David Thus saith the LORD I offer thee three things choose thee one of them that I may do it unto theeSo Gad came to David and told him and said unto him Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer I shall return to him that sent meAnd David said unto Gad I am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the LORD for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of manSo the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand menAnd when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the LORD repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people It is enough stay now thine hand And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the JebusiteAnd David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people and said Lo I have sinned and I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray thee be against me and against my fathers houseAnd Gad came that day to David and said unto him Go up rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the JebusiteAnd David according to the saying of Gad went up as the LORD commandedAnd Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the groundAnd Araunah said Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant And David said To buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the LORD that the plague may be stayed from the peopleAnd Araunah said unto David Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for woodAll these things did Araunah as a king give unto the king And Araunah said unto the king The LORD thy God accept theeAnd the king said unto Araunah Nay but I will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silverAnd David built there an altar unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings So the LORD was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from IsraelNow king David was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heatWherefore his servants said unto him Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heatSo they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel and found Abishag a Shunammite and brought her to the kingAnd the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her notThen Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself saying I will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before himAnd his father had not displeased him at any time in saying Why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after AbsalomAnd he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest and they following Adonijah helped himBut Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and the mighty men which belonged to David were not with AdonijahAnd Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth which is by En-rogel and called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of Judah the kings servantsBut Nathan the prophet and Benaiah and the mighty men and Solomon his brother he called notWherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon saying Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign and David our lord knoweth it notNow therefore come let me I pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son SolomonGo and get thee in unto king David and say unto him Didst not thou my lord O king swear unto thine handmaid saying Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth Adonijah reignBehold while thou yet talkest there with the king I also will come in after thee and confirm thy wordsAnd Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the kingAnd Bath-sheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king And the king said What wouldest thouAnd she said unto him My lord thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid saying Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throneAnd now behold Adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it notAnd he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host but Solomon thy servant hath he not calledAnd thou my lord O king the eyes of all Israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after himOtherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offendersAnd lo while she yet talked with the king Nathan the prophet also came inAnd they told the king saying Behold Nathan the prophet And when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the groundAnd Nathan said My lord O king hast thou said Adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throneFor he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and Abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say God save king AdonijahBut me even me thy servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and thy servant Solomon hath he not calledIs this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after himThen king David answered and said Call me Bath-sheba And she came into the kings presence and stood before the kingAnd the king sware and said As the LORD liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distressEven as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel saying Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will I certainly do this dayThen Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said Let my lord king David live for everAnd king David said Call me Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada And they came before the kingThe king also said unto them Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to GihonAnd let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say God save king SolomonThen ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over JudahAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said Amen the LORD God of my lord the king say so tooAs the LORD hath been with my lord the king even so be he with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king DavidSo Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davids mule and brought him to GihonAnd Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon And they blew the trumpet and all the people said God save king SolomonAnd all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of themAnd Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproarAnd while he yet spake behold Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came and Adonijah said unto him Come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidingsAnd Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon kingAnd the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings muleAnd Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again This is the noise that ye have heardAnd also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdomAnd moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king David saying God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne And the king bowed himself upon the bedAnd also thus said the king Blessed be the LORD God of Israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing itAnd all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his wayAnd Adonijah feared because of Solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altarAnd it was told Solomon saying Behold Adonijah feareth king Solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the swordAnd Solomon said If he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall dieSo king Solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon and Solomon said unto him Go to thine houseNow the days of David drew nigh that he should die and he charged Solomon his son sayingI go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a manAnd keep the charge of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of Moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyselfThat the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying If thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of IsraelMoreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feetDo therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peaceBut shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brotherAnd behold thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera a Benjamite of Bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim but he came down to meet me at Jordan and I sware to him by the LORD saying I will not put thee to death with the swordNow therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with bloodSo David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of DavidAnd the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years seven years reigned he in Hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in JerusalemThen sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father and his kingdom was established greatlyAnd Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon And she said Comest thou peaceably And he said PeaceablyHe said moreover I have somewhat to say unto thee And she said Say onAnd he said Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel set their faces on me that I should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the LORDAnd now I ask one petition of thee deny me not And she said unto him Say onAnd he said Speak I pray thee unto Solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wifeAnd Bath-sheba said Well I will speak for thee unto the kingBath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon to speak unto him for Adonijah And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right handThen she said I desire one small petition of thee I pray thee say me not nay And the king said unto her Ask on my mother for I will not say thee nayAnd she said Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wifeAnd king Solomon answered and said unto his mother And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab the son of ZeruiahThen king Solomon sware by the LORD saying God do so to me and more also if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own lifeNow therefore as the LORD liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who hath made me an house as he promised Adonijah shall be put to death this dayAnd king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and he fell upon him that he diedAnd unto Abiathar the priest said the king Get thee to Anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but I will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflictedSo Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD that he might fulfil the word of the LORD which he spake concerning the house of Eli in ShilohThen tidings came to Joab for Joab had turned after Adonijah though he turned not after Absalom And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and caught hold on the horns of the altarAnd it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and behold he is by the altar Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada saying Go fall upon himAnd Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD and said unto him Thus saith the king Come forth And he said Nay but I will die here And Benaiah brought the king word again saying Thus said Joab and thus he answered meAnd the king said unto him Do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed from me and from the house of my fatherAnd the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father David not knowing thereof to wit Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel and Amasa the son of Jether captain of the host of JudahTheir blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon David and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the LORDSo Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wildernessAnd the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of AbiatharAnd the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him Build thee an house in Jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whitherFor it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook Kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own headAnd Shimei said unto the king The saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many daysAnd it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath And they told Shimei saying Behold thy servants be in GathAnd Shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants and Shimei went and brought his servants from GathAnd it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and was come againAnd the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD and protested unto thee saying Know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any wither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me The word that I have heard is goodWhy then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I have charged thee withThe king said moreover to Shimei Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to David my father therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own headAnd king Solomon shall be blessed and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for everSo the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died And the kingdom was established in the hand of SolomonAnd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall of Jerusalem round aboutOnly the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD until those daysAnd Solomon loved the LORD walking in the statutes of David his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high placesAnd the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altarIn Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said Ask what I shall give theeAnd Solomon said Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this dayAnd now O LORD my God thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come inAnd thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitudeGive therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a peopleAnd the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thingAnd God said unto him Because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgmentBehold I have done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto theeAnd I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy daysAnd if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy daysAnd Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servantsThen came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before himAnd the one woman said O my lord I and this woman dwell in one house and I was delivered of a child with her in the houseAnd it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the houseAnd this womans child died in the night because she overlaid itAnd she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosomAnd when I rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when I had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which I did bearAnd the other woman said Nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son And this said No but the dead is thy son and the living is my son Thus they spake before the kingThen said the king The one saith This is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith Nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the livingAnd the king said Bring me a sword And they brought a sword before the kingAnd the king said Divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the otherThen spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said O my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it But the other said Let it be neither mine nor thine but divide itThen the king answered and said Give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereofAnd all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgmentSo king Solomon was king over all IsraelAnd these were the princes which he had Azariah the son of Zadok the priestElihoreph and Ahiah the sons of Shisha scribes Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud the recorderAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host and Zadok and Abiathar were the priestsAnd Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer and the kings friendAnd Ahishar was over the household and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tributeAnd Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provisionAnd these are their names The son of Hur in mount EphraimThe son of Dekar in Makaz and in Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elon-beth-hananThe son of Hesed in Aruboth to him pertained Sochoh and all the land of HepherThe son of Abinadab in all the region of Dor which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wifeBaana the son of Ahilud to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo and all Beth-shean which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah even unto the place that is beyond JokneamThe son of Geber in Ramoth-gilead to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh which are in Gilead to him also pertained the region of Argob which is in Bashan threescore great cities with walls and brasen barsAhinadab the son of Iddo had MahanaimAhimaaz was in Naphtali he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wifeBaanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in AlothJehoshaphat the son of Paruah in IssacharShimei the son of Elah in BenjaminGeber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan and he was the only officer which was in the landJudah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merryAnd Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt they brought presents and served Solomon all the days of his lifeAnd Solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of mealTen fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowlFor he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from Tiphsah even to Azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about himAnd Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from Dan even to Beer-sheba all the days of SolomonAnd Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemenAnd those officers provided victual for king Solomon and for all that came unto king Solomons table every man in his month they lacked nothingBarley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his chargeAnd God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shoreAnd Solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of EgyptFor he was wiser than all men than Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman and Chalcol and Darda the sons of Mahol and his fame was in all nations round aboutAnd he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and fiveAnd he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishesAnd there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdomAnd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for Hiram was ever a lover of DavidAnd Solomon sent to Hiram sayingThou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side until the LORD put them under the soles of his feetBut now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrentAnd behold I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God as the LORD spake unto David my father saying Thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my nameNow therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the SidoniansAnd it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said Blessed be the LORD this day which hath given unto David a wise son over this great peopleAnd Hiram sent to Solomon saying I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of firMy servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my householdSo Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desireAnd Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by yearAnd the LORD gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and they two made a league togetherAnd king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel and the levy was thirty thousand menAnd he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in Lebanon and two months at home and Adoniram was over the levyAnd Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountainsBeside the chief of Solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the workAnd the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the houseAnd Solomons builders and Hirams builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the houseAnd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomons reign over Israel in the month Zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the LORDAnd the house which king Solomon built for the LORD the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubitsAnd the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the houseAnd for the house he made windows of narrow lightsAnd against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round aboutThe nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the houseAnd the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in buildingThe door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the thirdSo he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedarAnd then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedarAnd the word of the LORD came to Solomon sayingConcerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto David thy fatherAnd I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people IsraelSo Solomon built the house and finished itAnd he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the cieling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of firAnd he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy placeAnd the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits longAnd the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seenAnd the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORDAnd the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedarSo Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with goldAnd the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with goldAnd within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits highAnd five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubitsAnd the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one sizeThe height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherubAnd he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the houseAnd he overlaid the cherubims with goldAnd he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and withoutAnd the floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and withoutAnd for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wallThe two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm treesSo also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wallAnd the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were foldingAnd he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved workAnd he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beamsIn the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid in the month ZifAnd in the eleventh year in the month Bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it So was he seven years in building itBut Solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his houseHe built also the house of the forest of Lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillarsAnd it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a rowAnd there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranksAnd all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranksAnd he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before themThen he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the otherAnd his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work Solomon made also an house for Pharaohs daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porchAll these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great courtAnd the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubitsAnd above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedarsAnd the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the LORD and for the porch of the houseAnd king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of TyreHe was a widows son of the tribe of Naphtali and his father was a man of Tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass And he came to king Solomon and wrought all his workFor he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them aboutAnd he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubitsAnd nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiterAnd he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiterAnd the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubitsAnd the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiterAnd he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof Jachin and he set up the left pillar and he called the name thereof BoazAnd upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finishedAnd he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round aboutAnd under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was castIt stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inwardAnd it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand bathsAnd he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of itAnd the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledgesAnd on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin workAnd every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every additionAnd the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not roundAnd under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubitAnd the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all moltenAnd there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itselfAnd in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the sameFor on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round aboutAfter this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one sizeThen made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laverAnd he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the southAnd Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORDThe two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillarsAnd four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillarsAnd the ten bases and ten lavers on the basesAnd one sea and twelve oxen under the seaAnd the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD were of bright brassIn the plain of Jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and ZarthanAnd Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found outAnd Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread wasAnd the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of goldAnd the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the templeSo was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORDThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto king Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David which is ZionAnd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim which is the seventh monthAnd all the elders of Israel came and the priests took up the arkAnd they brought up the ark of the LORD and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the Levites bring upAnd king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitudeAnd the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubimsFor the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof aboveAnd they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this dayThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of EgyptAnd it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the LORDSo that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORDThen spake Solomon The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darknessI have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for everAnd the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of Israel and all the congregation of Israel stoodAnd he said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel which spake with his mouth unto David my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it sayingSince the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house that my name might be therein but I chose David to be over my people IsraelAnd it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of IsraelAnd the LORD said unto David my father Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heartNevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my nameAnd the LORD hath performed his word that he spake and I am risen up in the room of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel as the LORD promised and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of IsraelAnd I have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the LORD which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of EgyptAnd Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heavenAnd he said LORD God of Israel there is no God like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heartWho hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this dayTherefore now LORD God of Israel keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him saying There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before meAnd now O God of Israel let thy word I pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant David my fatherBut will God indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have buildedYet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O LORD my God to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to dayThat thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said My name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this placeAnd hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people Israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgiveIf any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this houseThen hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousnessWhen thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this houseThen hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathersWhen heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest themThen hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritanceIf there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there beWhat prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people Israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this houseThen hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of menThat they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathersMoreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people Israel but cometh out of a far country for thy names sakeFor they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this houseHear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people Israel and that they may know that this house which I have builded is called by thy nameIf thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house that I have built for thy nameThen hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their causeIf they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or nearYet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying We have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickednessAnd so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy nameThen hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their causeAnd forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on themFor they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of ironThat thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people Israel to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto theeFor thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt O Lord GODAnd it was so that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD he arose from before the altar of the LORD from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heavenAnd he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice sayingBlessed be the LORD that hath given rest unto his people Israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his servantThe LORD our God be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake usThat he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathersAnd let these my words wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel at all times as the matter shall requireThat all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is none elseLet your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this dayAnd the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the LORDAnd Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the LORD two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORDThe same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offeringsAnd at that time Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt before the LORD our God seven days and seven days even fourteen daysOn the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant and for Israel his peopleAnd it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD and the kings house and all Solomons desire which he was pleased to doThat the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at GibeonAnd the LORD said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetuallyAnd if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgmentsThen I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever as I promised to David thy father saying There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of IsraelBut if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship themThen will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them and this house which I have hallowed for my name will I cast out of my sight and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peopleAnd at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land and to this houseAnd they shall answer Because they forsook the LORD their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evilAnd it came to pass at the end of twenty years when Solomon had built the two houses the house of the LORD and the kings houseNow Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of GalileeAnd Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him and they pleased him notAnd he said What cities are these which thou hast given me my brother And he called them the land of Cabul unto this dayAnd Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of goldAnd this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised for to build the house of the LORD and his own house and Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and GezerFor Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter Solomons wifeAnd Solomon built Gezer and Beth-horon the netherand Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderness in the landAnd all the cities of store that Solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominionAnd all the people that were left of the Amorites Hittites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites which were not of the children of IsraelTheir children that were left after them in the land whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this dayBut of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemenThese were the chief of the officers that were over Solomons work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the workBut Pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her then did he build MilloAnd three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD So he finished the houseAnd king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber which is beside Eloth on the shore of the Red sea in the land of EdomAnd Hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of SolomonAnd they came to Ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king SolomonAnd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD she came to prove him with hard questionsAnd she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heartAnd Solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her notAnd when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomons wisdom and the house that he had builtAnd the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD there was no more spirit in herAnd she said to the king It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdomHowbeit I believed not the words until I came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heardHappy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdomBlessed be the LORD thy God which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel because the LORD loved Israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justiceAnd she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king SolomonAnd the navy also of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stonesAnd the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this dayAnd king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty So she turned and went to her own country she and her servantsNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of goldBeside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of Arabia and of the governors of the countryAnd king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one targetAnd he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of LebanonMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best goldThe throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the staysAnd twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdomAnd all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of SolomonFor the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram once in three years came the navy of Tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocksSo king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdomAnd all the earth sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heartAnd they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by yearAnd Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at JerusalemAnd the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundanceAnd Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a priceAnd a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria did they bring them out by their meansBut king Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of Pharaoh women of the Moabites Ammonites Edomites Zidonians and HittitesOf the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel Ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon clave unto these in loveAnd he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heartFor it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God as was the heart of David his fatherFor Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians and after Milcom the abomination of the AmmonitesAnd Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD and went not fully after the LORD as did David his fatherThen did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jerusalem and for Molech the abomination of the children of AmmonAnd likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their godsAnd the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel which had appeared unto him twiceAnd had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the LORD commandedWherefore the LORD said unto Solomon Forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee I will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servantNotwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy fathers sake but I will rend it out of the hand of thy sonHowbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servants sake and for Jerusalems sake which I have chosenAnd the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon Hadad the Edomite he was of the kings seed in EdomFor it came to pass when David was in Edom and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in EdomFor six months did Joab remain there with all Israel until he had cut off every male in EdomThat Hadad fled he and certain Edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into Egypt Hadad being yet a little childAnd they arose out of Midian and came to Paran and they took men with them out of Paran and they came to Egypt unto Pharaoh king of Egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him landAnd Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of Tahpenes the queenAnd the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohs house and Genubath was in Pharaohs household among the sons of PharaohAnd when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the captain of the host was dead Hadad said to Pharaoh Let me depart that I may go to mine own countryThen Pharaoh said unto him But what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country And he answered Nothing howbeit let me go in any wiseAnd God stirred him up another adversary Rezon the son of Eliadah which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of ZobahAnd he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when David slew them of Zobah and they went to Damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in DamascusAnd he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon beside the mischief that Hadad did and he abhorred Israel and reigned over SyriaAnd Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda Solomons servant whose mothers name was Zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the kingAnd this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king Solomon built Millo and repaired the breaches of the city of David his fatherAnd the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of JosephAnd it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the fieldAnd Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve piecesAnd he said to Jeroboam Take thee ten pieces for thus saith the LORD the God of Israel Behold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to theeBut he shall have one tribe for my servant Davids sake and for Jerusalems sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of IsraelBecause that they have forsaken me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians Chemosh the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did David his fatherHowbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servants sake whom I chose because he kept my commandments and my statutesBut I will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribesAnd unto his son will I give one tribe that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen me to put my name thereAnd I will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over IsraelAnd it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as David my servant did that I will be with thee and build thee a sure house as I built for David and will give Israel unto theeAnd I will for this afflict the seed of David but not for everSolomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam And Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt unto Shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt until the death of SolomonAnd the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of SolomonAnd the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty yearsAnd Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his steadAnd Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him kingAnd it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat who was yet in Egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon and Jeroboam dwelt in EgyptThat they sent and called him And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spake unto Rehoboam sayingThy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve theeAnd he said unto them Depart yet for three days then come again to me And the people departedAnd king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived and said How do ye advise that I may answer this peopleAnd they spake unto him saying If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for everBut he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before himAnd he said unto them What counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighterAnd the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying Thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them My little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loinsAnd now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke I will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpionsSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying Come to me again the third dayAnd the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old mens counsel that they gave himAnd spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy and I will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpionsWherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the LORD that he might perform his saying which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of NebatSo when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying What portion have we in David neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse to your tents O Israel now see to thine own house David So Israel departed unto their tentsBut as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah Rehoboam reigned over themThen king Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the tribute and all Israel stoned him with stones that he died Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to JerusalemSo Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this dayAnd it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all Israel there was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah onlyAnd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of Israel to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of SolomonBut the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God sayingSpeak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the remnant of the people sayingThus saith the LORD Ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD and returned to depart according to the word of the LORDThen Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built PenuelAnd Jeroboam said in his heart Now shall the kingdom return to the house of DavidIf this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto Rehoboam king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to Rehoboam king of JudahWhereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem behold thy gods O Israel which brought thee up out of the land of EgyptAnd he set the one in Bethel and the other put he in DanAnd this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto DanAnd he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of LeviAnd Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in Judah and he offered upon the altar So did he in Bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had madeSo he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incenseAnd behold there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incenseAnd he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD and said O altar altar thus saith the LORD Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David Josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burnt upon theeAnd he gave a sign the same day saying This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken Behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured outAnd it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God which had cried against the altar in Bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying Lay hold on him And his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to himThe altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORDAnd the king answered and said unto the man of God Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again And the man of God besought the LORD and the kings hand was restored him again and became as it was beforeAnd the king said unto the man of God Come home with me and refresh thyself and I will give thee a rewardAnd the man of God said unto the king If thou wilt give me half thine house I will not go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this placeFor so was it charged me by the word of the LORD saying Eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camestSo he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to BethelNow there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their fatherAnd their father said unto them What way went he For his sons had seen what way the man of God went which came from JudahAnd he said unto his sons Saddle me the ass So they saddled him the ass and he rode thereonAnd went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah And he said I amThen he said unto him Come home with me and eat breadAnd he said I may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this placeFor it was said to me by the word of the LORD Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camestHe said unto him I am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD saying Bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water But he lied unto himSo he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank waterAnd it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him backAnd he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah saying Thus saith the LORD Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded theeBut camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the LORD did say to thee Eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathersAnd it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought backAnd when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcaseAnd behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dweltAnd when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said It is the man of God who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the LORD which he spake unto himAnd he spake to his sons saying Saddle me the ass And they saddled himAnd he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the assAnd the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury himAnd he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying Alas my brotherAnd it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying When I am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried lay my bones beside his bonesFor the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to passAfter this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high placesAnd this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earthAt that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sickAnd Jeroboam said to his wife Arise I pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam and get thee to Shiloh behold there is Ahijah the prophet which told me that I should be king over this peopleAnd take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the childAnd Jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah But Ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his ageAnd the LORD said unto Ahijah Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another womanAnd it was so when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said Come in thou wife of Jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for I am sent to thee with heavy tidingsGo tell Jeroboam Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people IsraelAnd rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant David who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyesBut hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy backTherefore behold I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all goneHim that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the LORD hath spoken itArise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall dieAnd all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of JeroboamMoreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day but what even nowFor the LORD shall smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the LORD to angerAnd he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam who did sin and who made Israel to sinAnd Jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child diedAnd they buried him and all Israel mourned for him according to the word of the LORD which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophetAnd the rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with this fathers and Nadab his son reigned in his steadAnd Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there And his mothers name was Naamah an AmmonitessAnd Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had doneFor they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green treeAnd there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of IsraelAnd it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against JerusalemAnd he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had madeAnd king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the kings houseAnd it was so when the king went into the house of the LORD that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamberNow the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their daysAnd Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David And his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitess And Abijam his son reigned in his steadNow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over JudahThree years reigned he in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Maachah the daughter of AbishalomAnd he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God as the heart of David his fatherNevertheless for Davids sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish JerusalemBecause David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of Uriah the HittiteAnd there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his lifeNow the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And there was war between Abijam and JeroboamAnd Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David and Asa his son reigned in his steadAnd in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over JudahAnd forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Maachah the daughter of AbishalomAnd Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD as did David his fatherAnd he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had madeAnd also Maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and Asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook KidronBut the high places were not removed nevertheless Asas heart was perfect with the LORD all his daysAnd he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the LORD silver and gold and vesselsAnd there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their daysAnd Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of JudahThen Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimon the son of Hezion king of Syria that dwelt at Damascus sayingThere is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel that he may depart from meSo Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel and smote Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maachah and all Cinneroth with all the land of NaphtaliAnd it came to pass when Baasha heard thereof that he left off building of Ramah and dwelt in TirzahThen king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha had builded and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and MizpahThe rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feetAnd Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his steadAnd Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and reigned over Israel two yearsAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sinAnd Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to GibbethonEven in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him and reigned in his steadAnd it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of Jeroboam he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the LORD which he spake by his servant Ahijah the ShiloniteBecause of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made Israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to angerNow the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their daysIn the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah twenty and four yearsAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sinThen the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha sayingForasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people Israel and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam and hast made my people Israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sinsBehold I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of NebatHim that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eatNow the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelSo Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah and Elah his son reigned in his steadAnd also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of Jeroboam and because he killed himIn the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah two yearsAnd his servant Zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in TirzahAnd Zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his steadAnd it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of Baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friendsThus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha according to the word of the LORD which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophetFor all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made Israel to sin in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanitiesNow the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelIn the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah And the people were encamped against Gibbethon which belonged to the PhilistinesAnd the people that were encamped heard say Zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all Israel made Omri the captain of the host king over Israel that day in the campAnd Omri went up from Gibbethon and all Israel with him and they besieged TirzahAnd it came to pass when Zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and diedFor his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD in walking in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make Israel to sinNow the rest of the acts of Zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelThen were the people of Israel divided into two parts half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath to make him king and half followed OmriBut the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath so Tibni died and Omri reignedIn the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel twelve years six years reigned he in TirzahAnd he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of Shemer owner of the hill SamariaBut Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD and did worse than all that were before himFor he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanitiesNow the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelSo Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria and Ahab his son reigned in his steadAnd in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two yearsAnd Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before himAnd it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians and went and served Baal and worshipped himAnd he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in SamariaAnd Ahab made a grove and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before himIn his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub according to the word of the LORD which he spake by Joshua the son of NunAnd Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab As the LORD God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my wordAnd the word of the LORD came unto him sayingGet thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before JordanAnd it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee thereSo he went and did according unto the word of the LORD for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before JordanAnd the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brookAnd it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the landAnd the word of the LORD came unto him sayingArise get thee to Zarephath which belongeth to Zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain theeSo he arose and went to Zarephath And when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said Fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drinkAnd as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said Bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine handAnd she said As the LORD thy God liveth I have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and dieAnd Elijah said unto her Fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy sonFor thus saith the LORD God of Israel The barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earthAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many daysAnd the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the LORD which he spake by ElijahAnd it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in himAnd she said unto Elijah What have I to do with thee O thou man of God art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my sonAnd he said unto her Give me thy son And he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bedAnd he cried unto the LORD and said O LORD my God hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her sonAnd he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the LORD and said O LORD my God I pray thee let this childs soul come into him againAnd the LORD heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revivedAnd Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah said See thy son livethAnd the woman said to Elijah Now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truthAnd it came to pass after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year saying Go shew thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the earthAnd Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab And there was a sore famine in SamariaAnd Ahab called Obadiah which was the governor of his house Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatlyFor it was so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD that Obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and waterAnd Ahab said unto Obadiah Go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beastsSo they divided the land between them to pass throughout it Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himselfAnd as Obadiah was in the way behold Elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said Art thou that my lord ElijahAnd he answered him I am go tell thy lord Behold Elijah is hereAnd he said What have I sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay meAs the LORD thy God liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said He is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee notAnd now thou sayest Go tell thy lord Behold Elijah is hereAnd it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from thee that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not and so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youthWas it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD how I hid an hundred men of the LORDs prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and waterAnd now thou sayest Go tell thy lord Behold Elijah is here and he shall slay meAnd Elijah said As the LORD of hosts liveth before whom I stand I will surely shew myself unto him to daySo Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet ElijahAnd it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him Art thou he that troubleth IsraelAnd he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and thou hast followed BaalimNow therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at Jezebels tableSo Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount CarmelAnd Elijah came unto all the people and said How long halt ye between two opinions if the LORD be God follow him but if Baal then follow him And the people answered him not a wordThen said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the LORD but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty menLet them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire underAnd call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the LORD and the God that answereth by fire let him be God And all the people answered and said It is well spokenAnd Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal Choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire underAnd they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon saying O Baal hear us But there was no voice nor any that answered And they leaped upon the altar which was madeAnd it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said Cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awakedAnd they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon themAnd it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regardedAnd Elijah said unto all the people Come near unto me And all the people came near unto him And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken downAnd Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the LORD came saying Israel shall be thy nameAnd with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seedAnd he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said Fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the woodAnd he said Do it the second time And they did it the second time And he said Do it the third time And they did it the third timeAnd the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with waterAnd it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said LORD God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy wordHear me O LORD hear me that this people may know that thou art the LORD God and that thou hast turned their heart back againThen the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trenchAnd when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said The LORD he is the God the LORD he is the GodAnd Elijah said unto them Take the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape And they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slew them thereAnd Elijah said unto Ahab Get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rainSo Ahab went up to eat and to drink And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his kneesAnd said to his servant Go up now look toward the sea And he went up and looked and said There is nothing And he said Go again seven timesAnd it came to pass at the seventh time that he said Behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand And he said Go up say unto Ahab Prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee notAnd it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain And Ahab rode and went to JezreelAnd the hand of the LORD was on Elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of JezreelAnd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the swordThen Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying So let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this timeAnd when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Beer-sheba which belongeth to Judah and left his servant thereBut he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said It is enough now O LORD take away my life for I am not better than my fathersAnd as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him Arise and eatAnd he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head And he did eat and drink and laid him down againAnd the angel of the LORD came again the second time and touched him and said Arise and eat because the journey is too great for theeAnd he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of GodAnd he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the LORD came to him and he said unto him What doest thou here ElijahAnd he said I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it awayAnd he said Go forth and stand upon the mount before the LORD And behold the LORD passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD but the LORD was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the LORD was not in the earthquakeAnd after the earthquake a fire but the LORD was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voiceAnd it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave And behold there came a voice unto him and said What doest thou here ElijahAnd he said I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it awayAnd the LORD said unto him Go return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint Hazael to be king over SyriaAnd Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy roomAnd it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slayYet I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal and every mouth which hath not kissed himSo he departed thence and found Elisha the son of Shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon himAnd he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said Let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee And he said unto him Go back again for what have I done to theeAnd he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat Then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto himAnd Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged Samaria and warred against itAnd he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city and said unto him Thus saith Ben-hadadThy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mineAnd the king of Israel answered and said My lord O king according to thy saying I am thine and all that I haveAnd the messengers came again and said Thus speaketh Ben-hadad saying Although I have sent unto thee saying Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy childrenYet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it awayThen the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said Mark I pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and I denied him notAnd all the elders and all the people said unto him Hearken not unto him nor consentWherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad Tell my lord the king All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do but this thing I may not do And the messengers departed and brought him word againAnd Ben-hadad sent unto him and said The gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow meAnd the king of Israel answered and said Tell him Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it offAnd it came to pass when Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilionsthat he said unto his servants Set yourselves in array And they set themselves in array against the cityAnd behold there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel saying Thus saith the LORD Hast thou seen all this great multitude behold I will deliver it in to thine hand this day and thou shalt know that I am the LORDAnd Ahab said By whom And he said Thus saith the LORD Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces Then he said Who shall order the battle And he answered ThouThen he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of Israel being seven thousandAnd they went out at noon But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped himAnd the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him saying There are men come out of SamariaAnd he said Whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them aliveSo these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed themAnd they slew every one his man and the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemenAnd the king of Israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the Syrians with a great slaughterAnd the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him Go strengthen thy self and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against theeAnd the servants of the king of Syria said unto him Their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than theyAnd do this thing Take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their roomsAnd number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they And he hearkened unto their voice and did soAnd it came to pass at the return of the year that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against IsraelAnd the children of Israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the Syrians filled the countryAnd there came a man of God and spake unto the king of Israel and said Thus saith the LORD Because the Syrians have said The LORD is God of the hills but he is not God of the valleys therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that I am the LORDAnd they pitched one over against the other seven days And so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one dayBut the rest fled to Aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamberAnd his servants said unto him Behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings let us I pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of Israel peradventure he will save thy lifeSo they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said Thy servant Ben-hadad saith I pray thee let me live And he said Is he yet alive he is my brotherNow the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said Thy brother Ben-hadad Then he said Go ye bring him Then Ben-hadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariotAnd Ben-hadad said unto him The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus as my father made in Samaria Then said Ahab I will send thee away with this covenant So he made a covenant with him and sent him awayAnd a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD Smite me I pray thee And the man refused to smite himThen said he unto him Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee And as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew himThen he found another man and said Smite me I pray thee And the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded himSo the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his faceAnd as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said Keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silverAnd as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone And the king of Israel said unto him So shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided itAnd he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophetsAnd he said unto him Thus saith the LORD Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his peopleAnd the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to SamariaAnd it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel hard by the palace of Ahab king of SamariaAnd Ahab spake unto Naboth saying Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee I will give thee the worth of it in moneyAnd Naboth said to Ahab The LORD forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto theeAnd Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers And he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no breadBut Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him Why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no breadAnd he said unto her Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite and said unto him Give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee I will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my vineyardAnd Jezebel his wife said unto him Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the JezreeliteSo she wrote letters in Ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with NabothAnd she wrote in the letters saying Proclaim a fast and set Naboth on high among the peopleAnd set two men sons of Belial before him to bear witness against him saying Thou didst blaspheme God and the king And then carry him out and stone him that he may dieAnd the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto themThey proclaimed a fast and set Naboth on high among the peopleAnd there came in two men children of Belial and sat before him and the men of Belial witnessed against him even against Naboth in the presence of the people saying Naboth did blaspheme God and the king Then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he diedThen they sent to Jezebel saying Naboth is stoned and is deadAnd it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead that Jezebel said to Ahab Arise take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for Naboth is not alive but deadAnd it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of itAnd the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite sayingArise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of Naboth whither he is gone down to possess itAnd thou shalt speak unto him saying Thus saith the LORD Hast thou killed and also taken possession And thou shalt speak unto him saying Thus saith the LORD In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thineAnd Ahab said to Elijah Hast thou found me O mine enemy And he answered I have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORDBehold I will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in IsraelAnd will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made Israel to sinAnd of Jezebel also spake the LORD saying The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of JezreelHim that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eatBut there was none like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD whom Jezebel his wife stirred upAnd he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the Amorites whom the LORD cast out before the children of IsraelAnd it came to pass when Ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softlyAnd the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite sayingSeest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me I will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will I bring the evil upon his houseAnd they continued three years without war between Syria and IsraelAnd it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of IsraelAnd the king of Israel said unto his servants Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of SyriaAnd he said unto Jehoshaphat Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horsesAnd Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel Inquire I pray thee at the word of the LORD to dayThen the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear And they said Go up for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the kingAnd Jehoshaphat said Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides that we might inquire of himAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat There is yet one man Micaiah the son of Imlah by whom we may inquire of the LORD but I hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say soThen the king of Israel called an officer and said Hasten hither Micaiah the son of ImlahAnd the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before themAnd Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said Thus saith the LORD With these shalt thou push the Syrians until thou have consumed themAnd all the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper for the LORD shall deliver it into the kings handAnd the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him saying Behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is goodAnd Micaiah said As the LORD liveth what the LORD saith unto me that will I speakSo he came to the king And the king said unto him Micaiah shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall we forbear And he answered him Go and prosper for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the kingAnd the king said unto him How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORDAnd he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the LORD said These have no master let them return every man to his house in peaceAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evilAnd he said Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD I saw the LORD sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his leftAnd the LORD said Who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead And one said on this manner and another said on that mannerAnd there came forth a spirit and stood before the LORD and said I will persuade himAnd the LORD said unto him Wherewith And he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets And he said Thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do soNow therefore behold the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning theeBut Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and smote Micaiah on the cheek and said Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto theeAnd Micaiah said Behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyselfAnd the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the kings sonAnd say Thus saith the king Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peaceAnd Micaiah said If thou return at all in peace the LORD hath not spoken by me And he said Hearken O people every one of youSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gileadAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battleBut the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying Fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of IsraelAnd it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said Surely it is the king of Israel And they turned aside to fight against him and Jehoshaphat cried outAnd it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel that they turned back from pursuing himAnd a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot Turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for I am woundedAnd the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariotAnd there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying Every man to his city and every man to his own countrySo the king died and was brought to Samaria and they buried the king in SamariaAnd one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the LORD which he spakeNow the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelSo Ahab slept with his fathers and Ahaziah his son reigned in his steadAnd Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of IsraelJehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of ShilhiAnd he walked in all the ways of Asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high placesAnd Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of IsraelNow the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father Asa he took out of the landThere was then no king in Edom a deputy was kingJehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at Ezion-geberThen said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships But Jehoshaphat would notAnd Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father and Jehoram his son reigned in his steadAhaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned two years over IsraelAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sinFor he served Baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel according to all that his father had doneThen Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of AhabAnd Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them Go inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this diseaseBut the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite Arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of EkronNow therefore thus saith the LORD Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die And Elijah departedAnd when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them Why are ye now turned backAnd they said unto him There came a man up to meet us and said unto us Go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him Thus saith the LORD Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely dieAnd he said unto them What manner of man was he which came up to meet you and told you these wordsAnd they answered him He was an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins And he said It is Elijah the TishbiteThen the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty And he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill And he spake unto him Thou man of God the king hath said Come downAnd Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty If I be a man of God then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty And there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fiftyAgain also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty And he answered and said unto him O man of God thus hath the king said Come down quicklyAnd Elijah answered and said unto them If I be a man of God let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fiftyAnd he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and besought him and said unto him O man of God I pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sightBehold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my life now be precious in thy sightAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah Go down with him be not afraid of him And he arose and went down with him unto the kingAnd he said unto him Thus saith the LORD Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely dieSo he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah because he had no sonNow the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd it came to pass when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from GilgalAnd Elijah said unto Elisha Tarry here I pray thee for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel And Elisha said unto him As the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee So they went down to BethelAnd the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto him Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day And he said Yea I know it hold ye your peaceAnd Elijah said unto him Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho And he said As the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee So they came to JerichoAnd the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day And he answered Yea I know it hold ye your peaceAnd Elijah said unto him Tarry I pray thee here for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan And he said As the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee And they two went onAnd fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by JordanAnd Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry groundAnd it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha Ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee And Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon meAnd he said Thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be soAnd it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heavenAnd Elisha saw it and he cried My father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof And he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two piecesHe took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of JordanAnd he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said Where is the LORD God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went overAnd when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him they said The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before himAnd they said unto him Behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley And he said Ye shall not sendAnd when they urged him till he was ashamed he said Send They sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him notAnd when they came again to him for he tarried at Jericho he said unto them Did I not say unto you Go notAnd the men of the city said unto Elisha Behold I pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barrenAnd he said Bring me a new cruse and put salt therein And they brought it to himAnd he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said Thus saith the LORD I have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren landSo the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of Elisha which he spakeAnd he went up from thence unto Bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him Go up thou bald head go up thou bald headAnd he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the LORD And there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of themAnd he went from thence to mount Carmel and from thence he returned to SamariaNow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned twelve yearsAnd he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of Baal that his father had madeNevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which made Israel to sin he departed not therefromAnd Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand rams with the woolBut it came to pass when Ahab was dead that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of IsraelAnd king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time and numbered all IsraelAnd he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying The king of Moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle And he said I will go up I am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horsesAnd he said Which way shall we go up And he answered The way through the wilderness of EdomSo the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed themAnd the king of Israel said Alas that the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of MoabBut Jehoshaphat said Is there not here a prophet of the LORD that we may inquire of the LORD by him And one of the king of Israels servants answered and said Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat which poured water on the hands of ElijahAnd Jehoshaphat said The word of the LORD is with him So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to himAnd Elisha said unto the king of Israel What have I to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother And the king of Israel said unto him Nay for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of MoabAnd Elisha said As the LORD of hosts liveth before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not look toward thee nor see theeBut now bring me a minstrel And it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the LORD came upon himAnd he said Thus saith the LORD Make this valley full of ditchesFor thus saith the LORD Ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beastsAnd this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD he will deliver the Moabites also into your handAnd ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stonesAnd it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of Edom and the country was filled with waterAnd when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood in the borderAnd they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as bloodAnd they said This is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another now therefore Moab to the spoilAnd when they came to the camp of Israel the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites so that they fled before them but they went forward smiting the Moabites even in their countryAnd they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote itAnd when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through even unto the king of Edom but they could notThen he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall And there was great indignation against Israel and they departed from him and returned to their own landNow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying Thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmenAnd Elisha said unto her What shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house And she said Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oilThen he said Go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a fewAnd when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is fullSo she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured outAnd it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son Bring me yet a vessel And he said unto her There is not a vessel more And the oil stayedThen she came and told the man of God And he said Go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the restAnd it fell on a day that Elisha passed to Shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread And so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat breadAnd she said unto her husband Behold now I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passeth by us continuallyLet us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thitherAnd it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay thereAnd he said to Gehazi his servant Call this Shunammite And when he had called her she stood before himAnd he said unto him Say now unto her Behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host And she answered I dwell among mine own peopleAnd he said What then is to be done for her And Gehazi answered Verily she hath no child and her husband is oldAnd he said Call her And when he had called her she stood in the doorAnd he said About this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son And she said Nay my lord thou man of God do not lie unto thine handmaidAnd the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of lifeAnd when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapersAnd he said unto his father My head my head And he said to a lad Carry him to his motherAnd when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then diedAnd she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went outAnd she called unto her husband and said Send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come againAnd he said Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moon nor sabbath And she said It shall be wellThen she saddled an ass and said to her servant Drive and go forward slack not thy riding for me except I bid theeSo she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel And it came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to Gehazi his servant Behold yonder is that ShunammiteRun now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her Is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child And she answered It is wellAnd when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but Gehazi came near to thrust her away And the man of God said Let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the LORD hath hid it from me and hath not told meThen she said Did I desire a son of my lord did I not say Do not deceive meThen he said to Gehazi Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the childAnd the mother of the child said As the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee And he arose and followed herAnd Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing Wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying The child is not awakedAnd when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bedHe went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the LORDAnd he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warmThen he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyesAnd he called Gehazi and said Call this Shunammite So he called her And when she was come in unto him he said Take up thy sonThen she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went outAnd Elisha came again to Gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant Set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophetsAnd one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them notSo they poured out for the men to eat And it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said O thou man of God there is death in the pot And they could not eat thereofBut he said Then bring meal And he cast it into the pot and he said Pour out for the people that they may eat And there was no harm in the potAnd there came a man from Baal-shalisha and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof And he said Give unto the people that they may eatAnd his servitor said What should I set this before an hundred men He said again Give the people that they may eat for thus saith the LORD They shall eat and shall leave thereofSo he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the LORDNow Naaman captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honourable because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leperAnd the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on Naamans wifeAnd she said unto her mistress Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosyAnd one went in and told his lord saying Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of IsraelAnd the king of Syria said Go to go and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel And he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raimentAnd he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying Now when this letter is come unto thee behold I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosyAnd it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against meAnd it was so when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in IsraelSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of ElishaAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying Go and wash in the Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be cleanBut Naaman was wroth and went away and said Behold I thought He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leperAre not Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I not wash in them and be clean So he turned and went away in a rageAnd his servants came near and spake unto him and said My father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee Wash and be cleanThen went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was cleanAnd he returned to the man of God he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said Behold now I know that there is no God in all earth but in Israel now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servantBut he said As the LORD liveth before whom I stand I will receive none And he urged him to take it but he refusedAnd Naaman said Shall there not then I pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the LORDIn this thing the LORD pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon the LORD pardon thy servant in this thingAnd he said unto him Go in peace So he departed from him a little wayBut Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said Behold my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the LORD liveth I will run after him and take somewhat of himSo Gehazi followed after Naaman And when Naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said Is all wellAnd he said All is well My master hath sent me saying Behold even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them I pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garmentsAnd Naaman said Be content take two talents And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before himAnd when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departedBut he went in and stood before his master And Elisha said unto him Whence comest thou Gehazi And he said Thy servant went no whitherAnd he said unto him Went not mine heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee Is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservantsThe leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snowAnd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha Behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for usLet us go we pray thee unto Jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell And he answered Go yeAnd one said Be content I pray thee and go with thy servants And he answered I will goSo he went with them And when they came to Jordan they cut down woodBut as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water and he cried and said Alas master for it was borrowedAnd the man of God said Where fell it And he shewed him the place And he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did swimTherefore said he Take it up to thee And he put out his hand and took itThen the king of Syria warred against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying In such and such a place shall be my campAnd the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying Beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the Syrians are come downAnd the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twiceTherefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of IsraelAnd one of his servants said None my lord O king but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamberAnd he said Go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him And it was told him saying Behold he is in DothanTherefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city aboutAnd when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots And his servant said unto him Alas my master how shall we doAnd he answered Fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with themAnd Elisha prayed and said LORD I pray thee open his eyes that he may see And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about ElishaAnd when they came down to him Elisha prayed unto the LORD and said Smite this people I pray thee with blindness And he smote them with blindness according to the word of ElishaAnd Elisha said unto them This is not the way neither is this the city follow me and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek But he led them to SamariaAnd it came to pass when they were come into Samaria that Elisha said LORD open the eyes of these men that they may see And the LORD opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of SamariaAnd the king of Israel said unto Elisha when he saw them My father shall I smite them shall I smite themAnd he answered Thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their masterAnd he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of IsraelAnd it came to pass after this that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host and went up and besieged SamariaAnd there was a great famine in Samaria and behold they besieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silverAnd as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying Help my lord O kingAnd he said If the LORD do not help thee whence shall I help thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepressAnd the king said unto her What aileth thee And she answered This woman said unto me Give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will eat my son to morrowSo we boiled my son and did eat him and I said unto her on the next day Give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her sonAnd it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his fleshThen he said God do so and more also to me if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this dayBut Elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his masters feet behind himAnd while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said Behold this evil is of the LORD what should I wait for the LORD any longerThen Elisha said Hear ye the word of the LORD Thus saith the LORD To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of SamariaThen a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said Behold if the LORD would make windows in heaven might this thing be And he said Behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereofAnd there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another Why sit we here until we dieIf we say We will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also Now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but dieAnd they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man thereFor the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another Lo the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon usWherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their lifeAnd when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid itThen they said one to another We do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the kings householdSo they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying We came to the camp of the Syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they wereAnd he called the porters and they told it to the kings house withinAnd the king arose in the night and said unto his servants I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us They know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying When they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the cityAnd one of his servants answered and said Let some take I pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it behold I say they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed and let us send and seeThey took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the Syrians saying Go and seeAnd they went after them unto Jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the Syrians had cast away in their haste And the messengers returned and told the kingAnd the people went out and spoiled the tents of the Syrians So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the LORDAnd the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of God had said who spake when the king came down to himAnd it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king saying Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of SamariaAnd that lord answered the man of God and said Now behold if the LORD should make windows in heaven might such a thing be And he said Behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereofAnd so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the gate and he diedThen spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying Arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the LORD hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven yearsAnd the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven yearsAnd it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her landAnd the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God saying Tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha hath doneAnd it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land And Gehazi said My lord O king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to lifeAnd when the king asked the woman she told him So the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until nowAnd Elisha came to Damascus and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick and it was told him saying The man of God is come hitherAnd the king said unto Hazael Take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of God and inquire of the LORD by him saying Shall I recover of this diseaseSo Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of Damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee saying Shall I recover of this diseaseAnd Elisha said unto him Go say unto him Thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely dieAnd he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed and the man of God weptAnd Hazael said Why weepeth my lord And he answered Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel their strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with childAnd Hazael said But what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing And Elisha answered The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over SyriaSo he departed from Elisha and came to his master who said to him What said Elisha to thee And he answered He told me that thou shouldest surely recoverAnd it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and Hazael reigned in his steadAnd in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reignThirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in JerusalemAnd he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the LORDYet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servants sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his childrenIn his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and made a king over themselvesSo Joram went over to Zair and all the chariots with him and he rose by night and smote the Edomites which compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tentsYet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day Then Libnah revolted at the same timeAnd the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David and Ahaziah his son reigned in his steadIn the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reignTwo and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of IsraelAnd he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD as did the house of Ahab for he was the son in law of the house of AhabAnd he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead and the Syrians wounded JoramAnd king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sickAnd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him Gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and go to Ramoth-gileadAnd when thou comest thither look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamberThen take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say Thus saith the LORD I have anointed thee king over Israel Then open the door and flee and tarry notSo the young man even the young man the prophet went to Ramoth-gileadAnd when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said I have an errand to thee O captain And Jehu said Unto which of all us And he said To thee O captainAnd he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him Thus saith the LORD God of Israel I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD even over IsraelAnd thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD at the hand of JezebelFor the whole house of Ahab shall perish and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in IsraelAnd I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of AhijahAnd the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel and there shall be none to bury her And he opened the door and fledThen Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him Is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee And he said unto them Ye know the man and his communicationAnd they said It is false tell us now And he said Thus and thus spake he to me saying Thus saith the LORD I have anointed thee king over IsraelThen they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying Jehu is kingSo Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead he and all Israel because of Hazael king of SyriaBut king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria And Jehu said If it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in JezreelSo Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel for Joram lay there And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see JoramAnd there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel and he spied the company of Jehu as he came and said I see a company And Joram said Take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say Is it peaceSo there went one on horseback to meet him and said Thus saith the king Is it peace And Jehu said What hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me And the watchman told saying The messenger came to them but he cometh not againThen he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and said Thus saith the king Is it peace And Jehu answered What hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind meAnd the watchman told saying He came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi for he driveth furiouslyAnd Joram said Make ready And his chariot was made ready And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against Jehu and met him in the portion of Naboth the JezreeliteAnd it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu that he said Is it peace Jehu And he answered What peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so manyAnd Joram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah There is treachery O AhaziahAnd Jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariotThen said Jehu to Bidkar his captain Take up and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite for remember how that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father the LORD laid this burden upon himSurely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons saith the LORD and I will requite thee in this plat saith the LORD Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground according to the word of the LORDBut when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house And Jehu followed after him and said Smite him also in the chariot And they did so at the going up to Gur which is by Ibleam And he fled to Megiddo and died thereAnd his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of DavidAnd in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over JudahAnd when Jehu was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a windowAnd as Jehu entered in at the gate she said Had Zimri peace who slew his masterAnd he lifted up his face to the window and said Who is on my side who And there looked out to him two or three eunuchsAnd he said Throw her down So they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode her under footAnd when he was come in he did eat and drink and said Go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughterAnd they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her handsWherefore they came again and told him And he said This is the word of the LORD which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of JezebelAnd the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that they shall not say This is JezebelAnd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria And Jehu wrote letters and sent to Samaria unto the rulers of Jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up Ahabs children sayingNow as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armourLook even out the best and meetest of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters houseBut they were exceedingly afraid and said Behold two kings stood not before him how then shall we standAnd he that was over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to Jehu saying We are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do thou that which is good in thine eyesThen he wrote a letter the second time to them saying If ye be mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your masters sons and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time Now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city which brought them upAnd it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the kings sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to JezreelAnd there came a messenger and told him saying They have brought the heads of the kings sons And he said Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morningAnd it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people Ye be righteous behold I conspired against my master and slew him but who slew all theseKnow now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant ElijahSo Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he left him none remainingAnd he arose and departed and came to Samaria And as he was at the shearing house in the wayJehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah and said Who are ye And they answered We are the brethren of Ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queenAnd he said Take them alive And they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither left he any of themAnd when he was departed thence he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him Is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart And Jehonadab answered It is If it be give me thine hand And he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariotAnd he said Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD So they made him ride in his chariotAnd when he came to Samaria he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the LORD which he spake to ElijahAnd Jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them Ahab served Baal a little but Jehu shall serve him muchNow therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal all his servants and all his priests let none be wanting for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live But Jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of BaalAnd Jehu said Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal And they proclaimed itAnd Jehu sent through all Israel and all the worshippers of Baal came so that there was not a man left that came not And they came into the house of Baal and the house of Baal was full from one end to anotherAnd he said unto him that was over the vestry Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal And he brought them forth vestmentsAnd Jehu went and Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal and said unto the worshippers of Baal Search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD but the worshippers of Baal onlyAnd when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings Jehu appointed fourscore men without and said If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his life shall be for the life of himAnd it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains Go in and slay them let none come forth And they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of BaalAnd they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal and burned themAnd they brake down the image of Baal and brake down the house of Baal and made it a draught house unto this dayThus Jehu destroyed Baal out of IsraelHowbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin Jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in DanAnd the LORD said unto Jehu Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of IsraelBut Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam which made Israel to sinIn those days the LORD began to cut Israel short and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of IsraelFrom Jordan eastward all the land of Gilead the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites from Aroer which is by the river Arnon even Gilead and BashanNow the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd Jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in Samaria And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his steadAnd the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight yearsAnd when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royalBut Jehosheba the daughter of king Joram sister of Ahaziah took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bedchamber from Athaliah so that he was not slainAnd he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years And Athaliah did reign over the landAnd the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him into the house of the LORD and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD and shewed them the kings sonAnd he commanded them saying This is the thing that ye shall do A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the kings houseAnd a third part shall be at the gate of Sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken downAnd two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the kingAnd ye shall compass the king around about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh inAnd the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to Jehoiada the priestAnd to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king Davids spears and shields that were in the temple of the LORDAnd the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple along by the altar and the templeAnd he brought forth the kings son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said God save the kingAnd when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the temple of the LORDAnd when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and Athaliah rent her clothes and cried Treason TreasonBut Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them Have her forth without the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword For the priest had said Let her not be slain in the house of the LORDAnd they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the kings house and there was she slainAnd Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORDs people between the king also and the peopleAnd all the people of the land went into the house of Baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORDAnd he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the kings house And he sat on the throne of the kingsAnd all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in quiet and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the kings houseSeven years old was Jehoash when he began to reignIn the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Zibiah of Beer-shebaAnd Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed himBut the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high placesAnd Jehoash said to the priests All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring into the house of the LORDLet the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be foundBut it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the houseThen king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests  and said unto them Why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the houseAnd the priests consented to receive no more money of the people neither to repair the breaches of the houseBut Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORDAnd it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the LORDAnd they gave the money being told into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the LORD and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of the LORDAnd to masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD and for all that was laid out for the house to repair itHowbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of the LORDBut they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the house of the LORDMoreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt faithfullyThe trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD it was the priestsThen Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it and Hazael set his face to go up to JerusalemAnd Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers kings of Judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD and in the kings house and sent it to Hazael king of Syria and he went away from JerusalemAnd the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew Joash in the house of Millo which goeth down to SillaFor Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David and Amaziah his son reigned in his steadIn the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned seventeen yearsAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which made Israel to sin he departed not therefromAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael all their daysAnd Jehoahaz besought the LORD and the LORD hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of Israel because the king of Syria oppressed themAnd the LORD gave Israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetimeNevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who made Israel sin but walked therein and there remained the grove also in SamariaNeither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of Syria had destroyed them and had made them like the dust by threshingNow the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd Jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in Samaria and Joash his son reigned in his steadIn the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned sixteen yearsAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel sin but he walked thereinAnd the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of IsraelAnd Joash slept with his fathers and Jeroboam sat upon his throne and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of IsraelNow Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said O my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereofAnd Elisha said unto him Take bow and arrows And he took unto him bow and arrowsAnd he said to the king of Israel Put thine hand upon the bow And he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the kings handsAnd he said Open the window eastward And he opened it Then Elisha said Shoot And he shot And he said The arrow of the LORDs deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek till thou have consumed themAnd he said Take the arrows And he took them And he said unto the king of Israel Smite upon the ground And he smote thrice and stayedAnd the man of God was wroth with him and said Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thriceAnd Elisha died and they buried him And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the yearAnd it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feetBut Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of JehoahazAnd the LORD was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them because of his covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yetSo Hazael king of Syria died and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his steadAnd Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war Three times did Joash beat him and recovered the cities of IsraelIn the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of JudahHe was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Jehoaddan of JerusalemAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD yet not like David his father he did according to all things as Joash his father didHowbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high placesAnd it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his fatherBut the children of the murderers he slew not according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses wherein the LORD commanded saying The fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall be put to death for his own sinHe slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took Selah by war and called the name of it Joktheel unto this dayThen Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us look one another in the faceAnd Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon saying Give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode down the thistleThou hast indeed smitten Edom and thine heart hath lifted thee up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and Judah with theeBut Amaziah would not hear Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh which belongeth to JudahAnd Judah was put to the worse before Israel and they fled every man to their tentsAnd Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah at Beth-shemesh and came to Jerusalem and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubitsAnd he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the kings house and hostages and returned to SamariaNow the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did and his might and

restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain according to the word of the LORD God of Israel which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah the son of Amittai the prophet which was of Gath-hepherFor the LORD saw the affliction of Israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper for IsraelAnd the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of JoashNow the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might how he warred and

doneHowbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places He built the higher gate of the house of the LORDNow the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahIn those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of RemaliahAnd Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father and Ahaz his son reigned in his steadIn the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reignTwenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God like David his fatherBut he walked in the way of the kings of Israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD cast out from before the children of IsraelAnd he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green treeThen Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome himAt that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria and drave the Jews from Elath and the Syrians came to Elath and dwelt there unto this daySo Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria saying I am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel which rise up against meAnd Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a present to the king of AssyriaAnd the king of Assyria hearkened unto him for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to Kir and slew RezinAnd king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria and saw an altar that was at Damascus and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereofAnd Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from DamascusAnd when the king was come from Damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereonand he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altarAnd he brought also the brasen altar which was before the LORD from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the LORD and put it on the north side of the altarAnd king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest saying Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat offering and the kings burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and the brasen altar shall be for me to inquire byThus did Urijah the priest according to all that king Ahaz commandedAnd king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stonesAnd the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of AssyriaNow the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David and Hezekiah his son reigned in his steadIn the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine yearsAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD but not as the kings of Israel that were before himAgainst him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria and Hoshea became his servant and gave him presentsAnd the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and brought no present to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prisonThen the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three yearsIn the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the MedesFor so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharoah king of Egypt and had feared other godsAnd walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel which they had madeAnd the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced cityAnd they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green treeAnd there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to angerFor they served idols whereof the LORD had said unto them Ye shall not do this thingYet the LORD testified against Israel and against Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying Turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by my servants the prophetsNotwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the LORD their GodAnd they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were round about them concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like themAnd they left all the commandments of the LORD their God and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven and served BaalAnd they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to angerTherefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of Judah onlyAlso Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God but walked in the statutes of Israel which they madeAnd the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sightFor he rent Israel from the house of David and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD and made them sin a great sinFor the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did they departed not from themUntil the LORD removed Israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this dayAnd the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Ava and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereofAnd so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the LORD therefore the LORD sent lions among them which slew some of themWherefore they spake to the king of Assyria saying The nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the God of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the God of the landThen the king of Assyria commanded saying Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the God of the landThen one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the LORDHowbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dweltAnd the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth and the men of Cuth made Nergal and the men of Hamath made AshimaAnd the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of SepharvaimSo they feared the LORD and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high placesThey feared the LORD and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thenceUnto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the LORD neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob whom he named IsraelWith whom the LORD had made a covenant and charged them saying Ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to themBut the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrificeAnd the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other godsAnd the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other godsBut the LORD your God ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemiesHowbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former mannerSo these nations feared the LORD and served their graven images both their children and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this dayNow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reignTwenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Abi the daughter of ZachariahAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that David his father didHe removed the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and he called it NehushtanHe trusted in the LORD God of Israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah nor any that were before himFor he clave to the LORD and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the LORD commanded MosesAnd the LORD was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of Assyria and served him notHe smote the Philistines even unto Gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced cityAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged itAnd at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of Hezekiah that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel Samaria was takenAnd the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the MedesBecause they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed his covenant and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded and would not hear them nor do themNow in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took themAnd Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish saying I have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will I bear And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of goldAnd Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the kings houseAt that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of AssyriaAnd the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem And they went up and came to Jerusalem And when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fullers fieldAnd when they had called to the king there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah which was over the household and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorderAnd Rab-shakeh said unto them Speak ye now to Hezekiah Thus saith the great king the king of Assyria What confidence is this wherein thou trustestThou sayest but they are but vain words I have counsel and strength for the war Now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against meNow behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon Egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is Pharoah king of Egypt unto all that trust on himBut if ye say unto me We trust in the LORD our God is not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem Ye shall worship before this altar in JerusalemNow therefore I pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria and I will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon themHow then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemenAm I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it The LORD said to me Go up against this land and destroy itThen said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh Speak I pray thee to thy servants in the Syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the Jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wallBut Rab-shakeh said unto them Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with youThen Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language and spake saying Hear the word of the great king the king of AssyriaThus saith the king Let not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his handNeither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD saying The LORD will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of AssyriaHearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria Make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cisternUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto Hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying The LORD will deliver usHath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of AssyriaWhere are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad where are the gods of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivah have they delivered Samaria out of mine handWho are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine handBut the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying Answer him notThen came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah which was over the household and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rab-shakehAnd it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORDAnd he sent Eliakim which was over the household and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of AmozAnd they said unto him Thus saith Hezekiah This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forthIt may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are leftSo the servants of king Hezekiah came to IsaiahAnd Isaiah said unto them Thus shall ye say to your master Thus saith the LORD Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed meBehold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own landSo Rab-shakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah for he had heard that he was departed from LachishAnd when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia Behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah sayingThus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of AssyriaBehold thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be deliveredHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden which were in ThelasarWhere is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim of Hena and IvahAnd Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORDAnd Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said O LORD God of Israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earthLORD bow down thine ear and hear open LORD thine eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living GodOf a truth LORD the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their landsAnd have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed themNow therefore O LORD our God I beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God even thou onlyThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying Thus saith the LORD God of Israel That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heardThis is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at theeWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the Holy One of IsraelBy the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord and hast said With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of Lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his CarmelI have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged placesHast thou not heard long ago how I have done it and of ancient times that I have formed it now have I brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heapsTherefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown upBut I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against meBecause thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore I will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camestAnd this shall be a sign unto thee Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereofAnd the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upwardFor out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount Zion the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do thisTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against itBy the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the LORDFor I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant Davids sakeAnd it came to pass that night that the angel of the LORD went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpsesSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at NinevehAnd it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of Armenia And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his steadIn those days was Hezekiah sick unto death And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said unto him Thus saith the LORD Set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not liveThen he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the LORD sayingI beseech thee O LORD remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight And Hezekiah wept soreAnd it came to pass afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the LORD came to him sayingTurn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people Thus saith the LORD the God of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORDAnd I will add unto thy days fifteen years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant Davids sakeAnd Isaiah said Take a lump of figs And they took and laid it on the boil and he recoveredAnd Hezekiah said unto Isaiah What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third dayAnd Isaiah said This sign shalt thou have of the LORD that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forth ten degrees or go back ten degreesAnd Hezekiah answered It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degreesAnd Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of AhazAt that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sickAnd Hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah shewed them notThen came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah and said unto him What said these men and from whence came they unto thee And Hezekiah said They are come from a far country even from BabylonAnd he said What have they seen in thine house And Hezekiah answered All the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed themAnd Isaiah said unto Hezekiah Hear the word of the LORDBehold the days come that all that is in thine houseand that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into Babylon nothing shall be left saith the LORDAnd of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of BabylonThen said Hezekiah unto Isaiah Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken And he said Is it not good if peace and truth be in my daysAnd the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd Hezekiah slept with his fathers and Manasseh his son reigned in his steadManasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Hephzi-bahAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD cast out before the children of IsraelFor he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for Baal and made a grove as did Ahab king of Israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served themAnd he built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD said In Jerusalem will I put my nameAnd he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORDAnd he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to angerAnd he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the LORD said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel will I put my name for everNeither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded themBut they hearkened not and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of IsraelAnd the LORD spake by his servants the prophets sayingBecause Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did which were before him and hath made Judah also to sin with his idolsTherefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel Behold I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingleAnd I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside downAnd I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemiesBecause they have done that which was evil in my sightand have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt even unto this dayMoreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORDNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of Uzza and Amon his son reigned in his steadAmon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of JotbahAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD as his father Manasseh didAnd he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped themAnd he forsook the LORD God of his fathers and walked not in the way of the LORDAnd the servants of Amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own houseAnd the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his steadNow the rest of the acts of Amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahAnd he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza and Josiah his son reigned in his steadJosiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of BoscathAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the way of David his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the leftAnd it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe to the house of the LORD sayingGo up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD which the keepers of the door have gathered of the peopleAnd let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the LORD and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD to repair the breaches of the houseUnto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the houseHowbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfullyAnd Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan and he read itAnd Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work that have the oversight of the house of the LORDAnd Shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book And Shaphan read it before the kingAnd it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothesAnd the king commanded Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Achbor the son of Michaiah and Shaphan the scribe and Asahiah a servant of the kings sayingGo ye inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning usSo Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam and Achbor and Shaphan and Asahiah went unto Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college and they communed with herAnd she said unto them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Tell the man that sent you to meThus saith the LORD Behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath readBecause they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenchedBut to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD thus shall ye say to him Thus saith the LORD God of Israel As touching the words which thou hast heardBecause thine heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD when thou heardest what I spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me I also have heard thee saith the LORDBehold therefore I will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place And they brought the king word againAnd the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of JerusalemAnd the king went up into the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORDAnd the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book And all the people stood to the covenantAnd the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried the ashes of them unto BethelAnd he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places round about Jerusalem them also that burned incense unto Baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heavenAnd he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD without Jerusalem unto the brook Kidron and burned it at the brook Kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the peopleAnd he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the LORD where the women wove hangings for the groveAnd he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from Geba to Beer-sheba and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the cityNevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethrenAnd he defiled Topheth which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to MolechAnd he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the LORD by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fireAnd the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD did the king beat down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook KidronAnd the high places that were before Jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon did the king defileAnd he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of menMoreover the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin had made both that altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the groveAnd as Josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed who proclaimed these wordsThen he said What title is that that I see And the men of the city told him It is the sepulchre of the man of God which came from Judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of BethelAnd he said Let him alone let no man move his bones So they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of SamariaAnd all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger Josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in BethelAnd he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and returned to JerusalemAnd the king commanded all the people saying Keep the passover unto the LORD your God as it is written in the book of this covenantSurely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel nor in all the days of the kings of Israel nor of the kings of JudahBut in the eighteenth year of king Josiah wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in JerusalemMoreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem did Josiah put away that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORDAnd like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of Moses neither after him arose there any like himNotwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withalAnd the LORD said I will remove Judah also out of my sight as I have removed Israel and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen and the house of which I said My name shall be thereNow the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahIn his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates and king Josiah went against him and he slew him at Megiddo when he had seen himAnd his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in his fathers steadJehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of LibnahAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his fathers had doneAnd Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath that he might not reign in Jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of goldAnd Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father and turned his name to Jehoiakim and took Jehoahaz away and he came to Egypt and died thereAnd Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto Pharaoh-nechohJehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of RumahAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his fathers had doneIn his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up and Jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against himAnd the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees and bands of the Syrians and bands of the Moabites and bands of the children of Ammon and sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the word of the LORD which he spake by his servants the prophetsSurely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of Manasseh according to all that he didAnd also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood which the LORD would not pardonNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of JudahSo Jehoiakim slept with his fathers and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his steadAnd the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of EgyptJehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in Jerusalem three months And his mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of JerusalemAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father had doneAt that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and the city was besiegedAnd Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city and his servants did besiege itAnd Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reignAnd he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD as the LORD had saidAnd he carried away all Jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the landAnd he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon and the kings mother and the kings wives and his officers and the mighty of the land those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to BabylonAnd all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of Babylon brought captive to BabylonAnd the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his fathers brother king in his stead and changed his name to ZedekiahZedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of LibnahAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that Jehoiakim had doneFor through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah until he had cast them out from his presence that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of BabylonAnd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came he and all his host against Jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round aboutAnd the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king ZedekiahAnd on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the landAnd the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the kings garden now the Chaldees were against the city round about and the king went the way toward the plainAnd the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army were scattered from himSo they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah and they gave judgment upon himAnd they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to BabylonAnd in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard a servant of the king of Babylon unto JerusalemAnd he burnt the house of the LORD and the kings house and all the houses of Jerusalem and every great mans house burnt he with fireAnd all the army of the Chaldees that were with the captain of the guard brake down the walls of Jerusalem round aboutNow the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon with the remnant of the multitude did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry awayBut the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmenAnd the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD did the Chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to BabylonAnd the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they awayAnd the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took awayThe two pillars one sea and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD the brass of all these vessels was without weightThe height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen workAnd the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the doorAnd out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that were in the kings presence which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the cityAnd Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon to RiblahAnd the king of Babylon smote them and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath So Judah was carried away out of their landAnd as for the people that remained in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan rulerAnd when all the captains of the armies they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah even Ishmael the

the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in mount GilboaAnd the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of SaulAnd the battle went sore against Saul and the archers hit him and he was wounded of the archersThen said Saul to his armourbearer Draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me But his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid So Saul took a sword and fell upon itAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead he fell likewise on the sword and diedSo Saul died and his three sons and all his house died togetherAnd when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that Saul and his sons were dead then they forsook their cities and fled and the Philistines came and dwelt in themAnd it came to pass on the morrow when the Philistines came to strip the slain that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount GilboaAnd when they had stripped him they took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the peopleAnd they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of DagonAnd when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to SaulThey arose all the valiant men and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven daysSo Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD even against the word of the LORD which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to inquire of itAnd inquired not of the LORD therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto David the son of JesseThen all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron saying Behold we are thy bone and thy fleshAnd moreover in time past even when Saul was king thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel and the LORD thy God said unto thee Thou shalt feed my people Israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people IsraelTherefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of the LORD by SamuelAnd David and all Israel went to Jerusalem which is Jebus where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the landAnd the inhabitants of Jebus said to David Thou shalt not come hither Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion which is the city of DavidAnd David said Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up and was chiefAnd David dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of DavidAnd he built the city round about even from Millo round about and Joab repaired the rest of the citySo David waxed greater and greater for the LORD of hosts was with himThese also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all Israel to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning IsraelAnd this is the number of the mighty men whom David had Jashobeam and Hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one timeAnd after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite who was one of the three mightiesHe was with David at Pas-dammim and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the PhilistinesAnd they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the Philistines and the LORD saved them by a great deliveranceNow three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David into the cave of Adullam and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of RephaimAnd David was then in the hold and the Philistines garrison was then at BethlehemAnd David longed and said Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem that is at the gateAnd the three brake through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David but David would not drink of it but poured it out to the LORDAnd said My God forbid it me that I should do this thing shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it Therefore he would not drink it These things did these three mightiestAnd Abishai the brother of Joab he was chief of the three for lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a name among the threeOf the three he was more honourable than the two for he was their captain howbeit he attained not to the first threeBenaiah the son of Jehoiada the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of Moab also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy dayAnd he slew an Egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the Egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand and slew him with his own spearThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and had the name among the three mightiesBehold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to the first three and David set him over his guardAlso the valiant men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Joab Elhanan the son of Dodo of BethlehemShammoth the Harorite Helez the PeloniteIra the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite Abi-ezer the

the TiziteEliel the Mahavite and Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam and Ithmah the MoabiteEliel and Obed and Jasiel the MesobaiteNow these are they that came to David to Ziklag while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish and they were among the mighty men helpers of the warThey were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of Sauls brethren of BenjaminThe chief was Ahiezer then Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite and Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth and Berachah and Jehu the

into the hold to the wilderness men of might and men of war fit for the battle that could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as swift as the roes upon the mountainsEzer the first Obadiah the second Eliab the thirdMishmannah the fourth Jeremiah the fifthAttai the sixth Eliel the seventhJohanan the eighth Elzabad the ninthJeremiah the tenth Machbanai the eleventhThese were of the sons of Gad captains of the host one of the least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousandThese are they that went over Jordan in the first month when it had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the westAnd there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto DavidAnd David went out to meet them and answered and said unto them If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the God of our fathers look thereon and rebuke itThen the spirit came upon Amasai who was chief of the captains and he said Thine are we David and on thy side thou son of Jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy God helpeth thee Then David received them and made them captains of the bandAnd there fell some of Manasseh to David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away saying He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our headsAs he went to Ziklag there fell to him of Manasseh Adnah and Jozabad and Jediael and Michael and Jozabad and Elihu and Zilthai captains of the thousands that were of ManassehAnd they helped David against the band of the rovers for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the hostFor at that time day by day there came to David to help him until it was a great host like the host of GodAnd these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war and came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the LORDThe children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the warOf the children of Simeon mighty men of valour for the war seven thousand and one hundredOf the children of Levi four thousand and six hundredAnd Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites and with him were three thousand and seven hundredAnd Zadok a young man mighty of valour and of his fathers house twenty and two captainsAnd of the children of Benjamin the kindred of Saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of SaulAnd of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their fathersAnd of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand which were expressed by name to come and make David kingAnd of the children of Issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandmentOf Zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heartAnd of Naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousandAnd of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundredAnd of Asher such as went forth to battle expert in war forty thousandAnd on the other side of Jordan of the Reubenites and the Gadites and of the half tribe of Manasseh with all manner of instruments of war for the battle an hundred and twenty thousandAll these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David kingAnd there they were with David three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for themMoreover they that were nigh them even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in IsraelAnd David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leaderAnd David said unto all the congregation of Israel If it seem good unto you and that it be of the LORD our God let us send abroad unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of Israel and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto usAnd let us bring again the ark of our God to us for we inquired not at it in the days of SaulAnd all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the peopleSo David gathered all Israel together from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearimAnd David went up and all Israel to Baalah that is to Kirjath-jearim which belonged to Judah to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on itAnd they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab and Uzza and Ahio drave the cartAnd David and all Israel played before God with all their might and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpetsAnd when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbledAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before GodAnd David was displeased because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this dayAnd David was afraid of God that day saying How shall I bring the ark of God home to meSo David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the GittiteAnd the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he hadNow Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an houseAnd David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people IsraelAnd David took more wives at Jerusalem and David begat more sons and daughtersNow these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem Shammua and Shobab Nathan and SolomonAnd Ibhar and Elishua and ElpaletAnd Nogah and Nepheg and JaphiaAnd Elishama and Beeliada and EliphaletAnd when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel all the Philistines went up to seek David And David heard of it and went out against themAnd the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of RephaimAnd David inquired of God saying Shall I go up against the Philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand And the LORD said unto him Go up for I will deliver them into thine handSo they came up to Baal-perazim and David smote them there Then David said God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazimAnd when they had left their gods there David gave a commandment and they were burned with fireAnd the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valleyTherefore David inquired again of God and God said unto him Go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry treesAnd it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the PhilistinesDavid therefore did as God commanded him and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to GazerAnd the fame of David went out into all lands and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nationsAnd David made him houses in the city of David and prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched for it a tentThen David said None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God and to minister unto him for everAnd David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place which he had prepared for itAnd David assembled the children of Aaron and the LevitesOf the sons of Kohath Uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred and twentyOf the sons of Merari Asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twentyOf the sons of Gershom Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirtyOf the sons of Elizaphan Shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundredOf the sons of Hebron Eliel the chief and his brethren fourscoreOf the sons of Uzziel Amminadab the chief and his brethren an hundred and twelveAnd David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites for Uriel Asaiah and Joel Shemaiah and Eliel and AmminadabAnd said unto them Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for itFor because ye did it not at the first the LORD our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due orderSo the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of IsraelAnd the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORDAnd David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joySo the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel and of his brethren Asaph the son of Berechiah and of the sons of Merari their brethren Ethan the son of KushaiahAnd with them their brethren of the second degree Zechariah Ben and Jaaziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni Eliab and Benaiah and Maaseiah and Mattithiah and Elipheleh and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel the portersSo the singers Heman Asaph and Ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brassAnd Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah with psalteries on AlamothAnd Mattithiah and Elipheleh and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel and Azaziah with harps on the Sheminith to excelAnd Chenaniah chief of the Levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilfulAnd Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the arkAnd Shebaniah and Jehoshaphat and Nethaneel and Amasai and Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the arkSo David and the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joyAnd it came to pass when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD that they offered seven bullocks and seven ramsAnd David was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the Levites that bare the ark and the singers and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers David also had upon him an ephod of linenThus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harpsAnd it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing and she despised him in her heartSo they brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before GodAnd when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the LORDAnd he dealt to every one of Israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wineAnd he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD and to record and to thank and praise the LORD God of IsraelAsaph the chief and next to him Zechariah Jeiel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps but Asaph made a sound with cymbalsBenaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of GodThen on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethrenGive thanks unto the LORD call upon his name make known his deeds among the peopleSing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous worksGlory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORDSeek the LORD and his strength seek his face continuallyRemember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouthO ye seed of Israel his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen onesHe is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earthBe ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generationsEven of the covenant which he made with Abraham and of his oath unto IsaacAnd hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an everlasting covenantSaying Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritanceWhen ye were but few even a few and strangers in itAnd when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another peopleHe suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakesSaying Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harmSing unto the LORD all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvationDeclare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nationsFor great is the LORD and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all godsFor all the gods of the people are idols but the LORD made the heavensGlory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his placeGive unto the LORD ye kindreds of the people give unto the LORD glory and strengthGive unto the LORD the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the LORD in the beauty of holinessFear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not movedLet the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations The LORD reignethLet the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is thereinThen shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD because he cometh to judge the earthO give thanks unto the LORD for he is good for his mercy endureth for everAnd say ye Save us O God of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praiseBlessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever And all the people said Amen and praised the LORDSo he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every days work requiredAnd Obed-edom with their brethren threescore and eight Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be portersAnd Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at GibeonTo offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD which he commanded IsraelAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the LORD because his mercy endureth for everAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of God And the sons of Jeduthun were portersAnd all the people departed every man to his house and David returned to bless his houseNow it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet Lo I dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtainsThen Nathan said unto David Do all that is in thine heart for God is with theeAnd it came to pass the same night that the word of God came to Nathan sayingGo and tell David my servant Thus saith the LORD Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell inFor I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to anotherWheresoever I have walked with all Israel spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people saying Why have ye not built me an house of cedarsNow therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David Thus saith the LORD of hosts I took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people IsraelAnd I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earthAlso I will ordain a place for my people Israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginningAnd since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an houseAnd it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that I will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and I will establish his kingdomHe shall build me an house and I will stablish his throne for everI will be his father and he shall be my son and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before theeBut I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermoreAccording to all these words and according to all this vision so did Nathan speak unto DavidAnd David the king came and sat before the LORD and said Who am I O LORD God and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hithertoAnd yet this was a small thing in thine eyes O God for thou hast also spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree O LORD GodWhat can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant for thou knowest thy servantO LORD for thy servants sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great thingsO LORD there is none like thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our earsAnd what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel whom God went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of EgyptFor thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou LORD becamest their GodTherefore now LORD let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast saidLet it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel even a God to Israel and let the house of David thy servant be established before theeFor thou O my God hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before theeAnd now LORD thou art God and hast promised this goodness unto thy servantNow therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest O LORD and it shall be blessed for everNow after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the PhilistinesAnd he smote Moab and the Moabites became Davids servants and brought giftsAnd David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river EuphratesAnd David took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen David also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariotsAnd when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand menThen David put garrisons in Syria-damascus and the Syrians became Davids servants and brought gifts Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he wentAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer and brought them to JerusalemLikewise from Tibhath and from Chun cities of Hadarezer brought David very much brass wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brassNow when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of ZobahHe sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him for Hadarezer had war with Tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brassThem also king David dedicated unto the LORD with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from Edom and from Moab and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from AmalekMoreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousandAnd he put garrisons in Edom and all the Edomites became Davids servants Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he wentSo David reigned over all Israel and executed judgment and justice among all his peopleAnd Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud recorderAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests and Shavsha was scribeAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethiten of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests and Shavsha was scribeAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites and the sons of David were chief about the kingNow it came to pass after this that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died and his son reigned in his steadAnd David said I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash because his father shewed kindness to me And David sent messengers  to comfort him concerning his fatthou that David doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the landWherefore Hanun took Davids servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them awayThen there went certain and told David how the men were served And he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed And the king said Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown and then returnAnd when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of Syria-maachah and out of ZobahSo they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of Maachah and his people who came and pitched before Medeba And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battleAnd when David heard of it he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty menAnd the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the fieldNow when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of Israel and put them in array against the SyriansAnd the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of AmmonAnd he said If the Syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee then I will help theeBe of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our God and let the LORD do that which is good in his sightSo Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle and they fled before himAnd when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled they likewise fled before Abishai his brother and entered into the city Then Joab came to JerusalemAnd when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel they sent messengers and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before themAnd it was told David and he gathered all Israel and passed over Jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians they fought with himBut the Syrians fled before Israel and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed Shophach the captain of the hostAnd when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel they made peace with David and became his servants neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any moreAnd it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle Joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of Ammon and came and besieged Rabbah But David tarried at Jerusalem And Joab smote Rabbah and destroyed itAnd David took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon Davids head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the cityAnd he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon And David and all the people returned to JerusalemAnd it came to pass after this that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subduedAnd there was war again with the Philistines and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite whose spear staff was like a weavers beamAnd yet again there was war at Gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giantBut when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea Davids brother slew himThese were born unto the giant in Gath and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servantsAnd Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number IsraelAnd David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people Go number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan and bring the number of them to me that I may know itAnd Joab answered The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lords servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to IsraelNevertheless the kings word prevailed against Joab Wherefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to JerusalemAnd Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew swordBut Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them for the kings word was abominable to JoabAnd God was displeased with this thing therefore he smote IsraelAnd David said unto God I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing but now I beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for I have done very foolishlyAnd the LORD spake unto Gad Davids seer sayingGo and tell David saying Thus saith the LORD I offer thee three things choose thee one of them that I may do it unto theeSo Gad came to David and said unto him Thus saith the LORD Choose theeEither three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the LORD even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent meAnd David said unto Gad I am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the LORD for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of manSo the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel and there fell of Israel seventy thousand menAnd God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the LORD beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed It is enough stay now thine hand And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the JebusiteAnd David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem Then David and the elders of Israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their facesAnd David said unto God Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray thee O LORD my God be on me and on my fathers house but not on thy people that they should be plaguedThen the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the JebusiteAnd David went up at the saying of Gad which he spake in the name of the LORDAnd Ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves Now Ornan was threshing wheatAnd as David came to Ornan Ornan looked and saw David and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to David with his face to the groundThen David said to Ornan Grant me the place of this threshingfloor that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the peopleAnd Ornan said unto David Take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes loI give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering I give it allAnd king David said to Ornan Nay but I will verily buy it for the full price for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD nor offer burnt offerings without costSo David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weightAnd David built there an altar unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the LORD and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offeringAnd the LORD commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereofAt that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite then he sacrificed thereFor the tabernacle of the LORD which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at GibeonBut David could not go before it to inquire of God for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORDThen David said This is the house of the LORD God and this is the altar of the burnt offering for IsraelAnd David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of GodAnd David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weightAlso cedar trees in abundance for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to DavidAnd David said Solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries I will therefore now make preparation for it So David prepared abundantly before his deathThen he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of IsraelAnd David said to Solomon My son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my GodBut the word of the LORD came to me saying Thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sightBehold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his daysHe shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and I will be his father and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for everNow my son the LORD be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the LORD thy God as he hath said of theeOnly the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning Israel that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy GodThen shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayedNow behold in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have I prepared and thou mayest add theretoMoreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of workOf the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number Arise therefore and be doing and the LORD be with theeDavid also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son sayingIs not the LORD your God with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the LORD and before his peopleNow set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORDSo when David was old and full of days he made Solomon his son king over IsraelAnd he gathered together all the princes of Israel with the priests and the LevitesNow the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousandOf which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD and six thousand were officers and judgesMoreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised the LORD with the

twenty years and upwardFor David said The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people that they may dwell in Jerusalem for everAnd also unto the Levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels of it for the service thereofFor by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and aboveBecause their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of GodBoth for the shewbread and for the fine flour

the ark of the covenant of the LORDAll this said David the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this patternAnd David said to Solomon his son Be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the LORD God even my God will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORDAnd behold the courses of the priests and the Levites even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandmentFurthermore David the king said unto all the congregation Solomon my son whom alone God hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the LORD GodNow I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundanceMoreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God I have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy houseEven three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses withalThe gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORDThen the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the kings work offered willinglyAnd gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of ironAnd they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD by the hand of Jehiel the GershoniteThen the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD and David the king also rejoiced with great joyWherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation and David said Blessed be thou LORD God of Israel our father for ever and everThine O LORD is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom O LORD and thou art exalted as head above allBoth riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto allNow therefore our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious nameBut who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given theeFor we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abidingO LORD our God all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all thine ownI know also my God that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness As for me in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things and now have I seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto theeO LORD God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto theeAnd give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which I have made provisionAnd David said to all the congregation Now bless the LORD your God And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the LORD and the kingAnd they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all IsraelAnd did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor and Zadok to be priestThen Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father and prospered and all Israel obeyed himAnd all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king David submitted themselves unto Solomon the kingAnd the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in IsraelThus David the son of Jesse reigned over all IsraelAnd the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years seven years reigned he in Hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in JerusalemAnd he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and Solomon his son reigned in his steadNow the acts of David the king first and last behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer and in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the book of Gad the seerWith all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the countriesAnd Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom and the LORD his God was with him and magnified him exceedinglyThen Solomon spake unto all Israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all Israel the chief of the fathersSo Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wildernessBut the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at JerusalemMoreover the brasen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the LORD and Solomon and the congregation sought unto itAnd Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon itIn that night did God appear unto Solomon and said unto him Ask what I shall give theeAnd Solomon said unto God Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father and hast made me to reign in his steadNow  O LORD God let thy promise unto David my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitudeGive me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so greatAnd God said to Solomon Because this was in thine heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom I have made thee kingWisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the likeThen Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over IsraelAnd Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at JerusalemAnd the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundanceAnd Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a priceAnd they fetched up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria by their meansAnd Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD and an house for his kingdomAnd Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred to oversee themAnd Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre saying As thou didst deal with David my father and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein even so deal with meBehold I build an house to the name of the LORD my God to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God This is an ordinance for ever to IsraelAnd the house which I build is great for great is our God above all godsBut who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am I then that I should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before himSend me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my father did provideSend me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of Lebanon for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servantsEven to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful greatAnd behold I will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oilThen Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing which he sent to Solomon Because the LORD hath loved his people he hath made thee king over themHuram said moreover Blessed be the LORD God of Israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to David the king a wise son endued with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the LORD and an house for his kingdomAnd now I have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of Huram my fathersThe son of a woman of the daughters of Dan and his father was a man of Tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord David thy fatherNow therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servantsAnd we will cut wood out of Lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa and thou shall carry it up to JerusalemAnd Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundredAnd he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a workThen Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah where the LORD appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the JebusiteAnd he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reignNow these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubitsAnd the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure goldAnd the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chainsAnd he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of ParvaimHe overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the wallsAnd he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talentsAnd the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold And he overlaid the upper chambers with goldAnd in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with goldAnd the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherubAnd one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherubThe wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inwardAnd he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereonAlso he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubitsAnd he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chainsAnd he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin and the name of that on the left BoazMoreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereofAlso he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round aboutAnd under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about Two rows of oxen were cast when it was castIt stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inwardAnd the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it received and held three thousand bathsHe made also ten lavers and put five on the right handand five on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash inAnd he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the leftHe made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left And he made an hundred basons of goldFurthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brassAnd he set the sea on the right side of the east end over against the southAnd Huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of GodTo wit the two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillarsAnd four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillarsHe made also bases and lavers made he upon the basesOne sea and twelve oxen under itThe pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brassIn the plain of Jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and ZeredathahThus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found outAnd Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was setMoreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn after the manner before the oracle of pure goldAnd the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that perfect goldAnd the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple were of goldThus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of GodThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David which is ZionWherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh monthAnd all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the arkAnd they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the Levites bring upAlso king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitudeAnd the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubimsFor the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof aboveAnd they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without And there it is unto this dayThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of EgyptAnd it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by courseAlso the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asaph of Heman of Jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpetsIt came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the LORD saying For he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the LORDSo that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of GodThen said Solomon The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darknessBut I have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for everAnd the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel and all the congregation of Israel stoodAnd he said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David sayingSince the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people IsraelBut I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen David to be over my people IsraelNow it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of IsraelBut the LORD said to David my father Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heartNotwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my nameThe LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for I am risen up in the room of David my father and am set on the throne of Israel as the LORD promised and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of IsraelAnd in it have I put the ark wherein is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the children of IsraelAnd he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his handsFor Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heavenAnd said O LORD God of Israel there is no God like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their heartsThou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this dayNow therefore O LORD God of Israel keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him saying There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before meNow then O LORD God of Israel let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant DavidBut will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which I have builtHave respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O LORD my God to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before theeThat thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this placeHearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people Israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgiveIf a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this houseThen hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousnessAnd if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this houseThen hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathersWhen the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict themThen hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritanceIf there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there beThen what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people Israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this houseThen hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of menThat they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathersMoreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people Israel but is come from a far country for thy great names sake and thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in this houseThen hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people Israel and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy nameIf thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy nameThen hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication and maintain their causeIf they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or nearYet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying We have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt wickedlyIf they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which I have built for thy nameThen hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against theeNow my God let I beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this placeNow therefore arise O LORD God into thy resting place thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests O LORD God be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodnessO LORD God turn not away the face of thine anointed remember the mercies of David thy servantNow when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the LORD filled the houseAnd the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORDs houseAnd when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the LORD upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and praised the LORD saying For he is good for his mercy endureth for everThen the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORDAnd king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of GodAnd the priests waited on their offices the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD which David the king had made to praise the LORD because his mercy endureth for ever when David praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all Israel stoodMoreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fatAlso at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days and all Israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of EgyptAnd in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven daysAnd on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David and to Solomon and to Israel his peopleThus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the kings house and all that came into Solomons heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house he prosperously effectedAnd the LORD appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him I have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrificeIf I shut up heaven that there be no rain or if I command the locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among my peopleIf my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their landNow mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this placeFor now have I chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetuallyAnd as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked and do according to all that I have commanded thee and shalt observe my statues and my judgmentsThen will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom according as I have covenanted with David thy father saying There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in IsraelBut if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship themThen will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them and this house which I have sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nationsAnd this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land and unto this houseAnd it shall be answered Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon themAnd it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own houseThat the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon Solomon built them and caused the children of Israel to dwell thereAnd Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and prevailed against itAnd he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in HamathAlso he built Beth-horon the upper and Beth-horon the nether fenced cities with walls gates and barsAnd Baalath and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominionAs for all the people that were left of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites which were not of IsraelBut of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of Israel consumed not them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this dayBut of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemenAnd these were the chief of king Solomons officers even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the peopleAnd Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her for he said My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the LORD hath comeThen Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the porchEven after a certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of Moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernaclesAnd he appointed according to the order of David his father the courses of the priests to their service and the Levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had David the man of God commandedAnd they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuresNow all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD and until it was finished So the house of the LORD was perfectedThen went Solomon to Ezion-geber and to Eloth at the sea side in the land of EdomAnd Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king SolomonAnd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heartAnd Solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her notAnd when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon and the house that he had builtAnd the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD there was no more spirit in herAnd she said to the king It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdomHowbeit I believed not their words until I came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou exceedest the fame that I heardHappy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdomBlessed be the LORD thy God which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the LORD thy God because thy God loved Israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and justiceAnd she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king SolomonAnd the servants also of Huram and the servants of Solomon which brought gold from Ophir brought algum trees and precious stonesAnd the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD and to the kings palace and harps and psalteries for singers and there were none such seen before in the land of JudahAnd king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king So she turned and went away to her own land she and her servantsNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of goldBeside that which chapmen and merchants brought And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to SolomonAnd king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one targetAnd three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield And the king put them in the house of the forest of LebanonMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure goldAnd there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the sitting place and two lions standing by the staysAnd twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps There was not the like made in any kingdomAnd all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of SolomonFor the kings ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocksAnd king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdomAnd all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heartAnd they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules a rate year by yearAnd Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at JerusalemAnd he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines and to the border of EgyptAnd the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundanceAnd they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all landsNow the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of NebatAnd Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty yearsAnd Solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his steadAnd Rehoboam went to Shechem for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him kingAnd it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat who was in Egypt whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king heard it that Jeroboam returned out of EgyptAnd they sent and called him So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam sayingThy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve theeAnd he said unto them Come again unto me after three days And the people departedAnd king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived saying What counsel give ye me to return answer to this peopleAnd they spake unto him saying If thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants for everBut he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before himAnd he said unto them What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me saying Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon usAnd the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him saying Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee saying Thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou say unto them My little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loinsFor whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you I will put more to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpionsSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king bade saying Come again to me on the third dayAnd the king answered them roughly and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old menAnd answered them after the advice of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy but I will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpionsSo the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of God that the LORD might perform his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of NebatAnd when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying What portion have we in David and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse every man to your tents O Israel and now David see to thine own house So all Israel went to their tentsBut as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah Rehoboam reigned over themThen king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of Israel stoned him with stones that he died But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to JerusalemAnd Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this dayAnd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against Israel that he might bring the kingdom again to RehoboamBut the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God sayingSpeak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin sayingThus saith the LORD Ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me And they obeyed the words of the LORD and returned from going against JeroboamAnd Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem and built cities for defence in JudahHe built even Bethlehem and Etam and TekoaAnd Beth-zur and Shoco and AdullamAnd Gath and Mareshah and ZiphAnd Adoraim and Lachish and AzekahAnd Zorah and Aijalon and Hebron which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced citiesAnd he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wineAnd in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having Judah and Benjamin on his sideAnd the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coastsFor the Levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priests office unto the LORDAnd he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had madeAnd after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathersSo they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of David and SolomonAnd Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of JesseWhich bare him children Jeush and Shamariah and ZahamAnd after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom which bare him Abijah and Attai and Ziza and ShelomithAnd Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughtersAnd Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him kingAnd he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance And he desired many wivesAnd it came to pass when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the LORD and all Israel with himAnd it came to pass that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem because they had transgressed against the LORDWith twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt the Lubims the Sukkiims and the EthiopiansAnd he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah and came to JerusalemThen came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak and said unto them Thus saith the LORD Ye have forsaken me and therefore have I also left you in the hand of ShishakWhereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and they said The LORD is righteousAnd when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah saying They have humbled themselves therefore I will not destroy them but I will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of ShishakNevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countriesSo Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the kings house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had madeInstead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the kings houseAnd when the king entered into the house of the LORD the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamberAnd when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in Judah things went wellSo king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there And his mothers name was Naamah an AmmonitessAnd he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORDNow the acts of Rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continuallyAnd Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David and Abijah his son reigned in his steadNow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over JudahHe reigned three years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah And there was war between Abijah and JeroboamAnd Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valourAnd Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim which is in mount Ephraim and said Hear me thou Jeroboam and all IsraelOught ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of saltYet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David is risen up and hath rebelled against his lordAnd there are gathered unto him vain men the children of Belial and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand themAnd now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David and ye be a great multitude and there are with you golden calves which Jeroboam made you for godsHave ye not cast out the priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron and the Levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no godsBut as for us the LORD is our God and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the LORD are the sons of Aaron and the Levites wait upon their businessAnd they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the LORD our God but ye have forsaken himAnd behold God himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you O children of Israel fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers for ye shall not prosperBut Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before Judah and the ambushment was behind themAnd when Judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the LORD and the priests sounded with the trumpetsThen the men of Judah gave a shout and as the men of Judah shouted it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and JudahAnd the children of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered them into their handAnd Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen menThus the children of Israel were brought under at that time and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathersAnd Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him Bethel with the towns thereof and Jeshnah with the towns thereof and Ephrain with the towns thereofNeither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah and the LORD struck him and he diedBut Abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughtersAnd the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet IddoSo Abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David and Asa his son reigned in his stead In his days the land was quiet ten yearsAnd Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his GodFor he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the grovesAnd commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to do the law and the commandmentAlso he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before himAnd he built fenced cities in Judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the LORD had given him restTherefore he said unto Judah Let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the LORD our God we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side So they built and prosperedAnd Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of Judah three hundred thousand and out of Benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valourAnd there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto MareshahThen Asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at MareshahAnd Asa cried unto the LORD his God and said LORD it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us O LORD our God for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude O LORD thou art our God let not man prevail against theeSo the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah and the Ethiopians fledAnd Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar and the Ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the LORD and before his host and they carried away very much spoilAnd they smote all the cities round about Gerar for the fear of the LORD came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in themThey smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to JerusalemAnd the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of OdedAnd he went out to meet Asa and said unto him Hear ye me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin The LORD is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake youNow for a long season Israel hath been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without lawBut when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel and sought him he was found of themAnd in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countriesAnd nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for God did vex them with all adversityBe ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewardedAnd when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim and renewed the altar of the LORD that was before the porch of the LORDAnd he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh and out of Simeon for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the LORD his God was with himSo they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of AsaAnd they offered unto the LORD the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheepAnd they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soulThat whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or womanAnd they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornetsAnd all Judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the LORD gave them rest round aboutAnd also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and Asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook KidronBut the high places were not taken away out of Israel nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his daysAnd he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vesselsAnd there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of AsaIn the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of JudahThen Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the kings house and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria that dwelt at Damascus sayingThere is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold I have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with Baasha king of Israel that he may depart from meAnd Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel and they smote Ijon and Dan and Abel-maim and all the store cities of NaphtaliAnd it came to pass when Baasha heard it that he left off building of Ramah and let his work ceaseThen Asa the king took all Judah and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha was building and he built therewith Geba and MizpahAnd at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said unto him Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the LORD thy God therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine handWere not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the LORD he delivered them into thine handFor the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him Herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have warsThen Asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing And Asa oppressed some of the people the same timeAnd behold the acts of Asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and IsraelAnd Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD but to the physiciansAnd Asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reignAnd they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of David and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for himAnd Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against IsraelAnd he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had takenAnd the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father David and sought not unto BaalimBut sought to the LORD God of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of IsraelTherefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundanceAnd his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD moreover he took away the high places and groves out of JudahAlso in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to Ben-hail and to Obadiah and to Zechariah and to Nethaneel and to Michaiah to teach in the cities of JudahAnd with them he sent Levites even Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tob-adonijah Levites and with them Elishama and Jehoram priestsAnd they taught in Judah and had the book of the law of the LORD with them and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the peopleAnd the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah so that they made no war against JehoshaphatAlso some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the Arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goatsAnd Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in Judah castles and cities of storeAnd he had much business in the cities of Judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in JerusalemAnd these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers Of Judah the captains of thousands Adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousandAnd next to him was Jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousandAnd next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri who willingly offered himself unto the LORD and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valourAnd of Benjamin Eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousandAnd next him was Jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the warThese waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all JudahNow Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with AhabAnd after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gileadAnd Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead And he answered him I am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the warAnd Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel Inquire I pray thee at the word of the LORD to dayTherefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear And they said Go up for God will deliver it into the kings handBut Jehoshaphat said Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides that we might inquire of himAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD but I hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is Micaiah the son of Imla And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say soAnd the king of Israel called for one of his officers and said Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of ImlaAnd the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before themAnd Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said Thus saith the LORD With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumedAnd all the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the kingAnd the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him saying Behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore I pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou goodAnd Micaiah said As the LORD liveth even what my God saith that will I speakAnd when he was come to the king the king said unto him Micaiah shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear And he said Go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your handAnd the king said to him How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORDThen he said I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the LORD said These have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peaceAnd the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evilAgain he said Therefore hear the word of the LORD I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his leftAnd the LORD said Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead And one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that mannerThen there came out a spirit and stood before the LORD and said I will entice him And the LORD said unto him WherewithAnd he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets And the LORD said Thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even soNow therefore behold the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the LORD hath spoken evil against theeThen Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and smote Micaiah upon the cheek and said Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto theeAnd Micaiah said Behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyselfThen the king of Israel said Take ye Micaiah and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the kings sonAnd say Thus saith the king Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I return in peaceAnd Micaiah said If thou certainly return in peace then hath not the LORD spoken by me And he said Hearken all ye peopleSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gileadAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes So the king of Israel disguised himself and they went to the battleNow the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying Fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of IsraelAnd it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said It is the king of Israel Therefore they compassed about him to fight but Jehoshaphat cried out and the LORD helped him and God moved them to depart from himFor it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel they turned back again from pursuing himAnd a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man Turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for I am woundedAnd the battle increased that day howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he diedAnd Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to JerusalemAnd Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king Jehoshaphat Shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the LORD therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORDNevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek GodAnd Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathersAnd he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah city by cityAnd said to the judges Take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the LORD who is with you in the judgmentWherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God nor respect of persons nor taking of giftsMoreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies when they returned to JerusalemAnd he charged them saying Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD faithfully and with a perfect heartAnd what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not trespassAnd behold Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the ruler of the house of Judah for all the kings matters also the Levites shall be officers before you Deal courageously and the LORD shall be with the goodIt came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other beside the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battleThen there came some that told Jehoshaphat saying There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria and behold they be Hazazon-tamar which is En-gediAnd Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the LORD and proclaimed a fast throughout all JudahAnd Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the LORD even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORDAnd Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD before the new courtAnd said O LORD God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand theeArt not thou our God who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for everAnd they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name sayingIf when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and helpAnd now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them notBehold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inheritO our God wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon theeAnd all Judah stood before the LORD with their little ones their wives and their childrenThen upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah the son of Benaiah the son of Jeiel the son of Mattaniah a Levite of the sons of Asaph came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregationAnd he said Hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou king Jehoshaphat Thus saith the LORD unto you Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but GodsTo morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of Ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of JeruelYe shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the LORD with you O Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the LORD will be with youAnd Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD worshipping the LORDAnd the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korhites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on highAnd they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said Hear me O Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem Believe in the LORD your God so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosperAnd when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the LORD and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say Praise the LORD for his mercy endureth for everAnd when they began to sing and to praise the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount Seir which were come against Judah and they were smittenFor the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir every one helped to destroy anotherAnd when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escapedAnd when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so muchAnd on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah for there they blessed the LORD therefore the name of the same place was called The valley of Berachah unto this dayThen they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to Jerusalem with joy for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemiesAnd they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORDAnd the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of IsraelSo the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet for his God gave him rest round aboutAnd Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of ShilhiAnd he walked in the way of Asa his father and departed not from it doing that which was right in the sight of the LORDHowbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathersNow the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of IsraelAnd after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel who did very wickedlyAnd he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish and they made the ships in Ezion-geberThen Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah the LORD hath broken thy works And the ships were broken that they were not able to go to TarshishNow Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David And Jehoram his son reigned in his steadAnd he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat Azariah and Jehiel and Zechariah and Azariah and Michael and Shephatiah all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of IsraelAnd their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in Judah but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram because he was the firstbornNow when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of IsraelJehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in JerusalemAnd he walked in the way of the kings of Israel like as did the house of Ahab for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORDHowbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant that he had made with David and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for everIn his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah and made themselves a kingThen Jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the Edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariotsSo the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathersMoreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled Judah theretoAnd there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet saying Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of Asa king of JudahBut hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house which were better than thyselfBehold with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goodsAnd thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by dayMoreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians that were near the EthiopiansAnd they came up into Judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save Jehoahaz the youngest of his sonsAnd after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable diseaseAnd it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathersThirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired Howbeit they buried him in the city of David but not in the sepulchres of the kingsAnd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reignedForty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Athaliah the daughter of OmriHe also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother was his counseller to do wickedlyWherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab for they were his counsellers after the death of his father to his destructionHe walked also after their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead and the Syrians smote JoramAnd he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah when he fought with Hazael king of Syria And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel because he was sickAnd the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram for when he was come he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of AhabAnd it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah that ministered to Ahaziah he slew themAnd he sought Ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in Samaria and brought him to Jehu and when they had slain him they buried him Because said they he is the son of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdomBut when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of JudahBut Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber So Jehoshabeath the daughter of king Jehoram the wife of Jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of Ahaziah hid him from Athaliah so that she slew him notAnd he was with them hid in the house of God six years and Athaliah reigned over the landAnd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds Azariah the son of Jeroham and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan and Azariah the son of Obed and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah and Elishaphat the son of Zichri into covenant with himAnd they went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel and they came to JerusalemAnd all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God And he said unto them Behold the kings son shall reign as the LORD hath said of the sons of DavidThis is the thing that ye shall do A third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the Levites shall be porters of the doorsAnd a third part shall be at the kings house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORDBut let none come into the house of the LORD save the priests and they that minister of the Levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORDAnd the Levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth outSo the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the coursesMoreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king Davids which were in the house of GodAnd he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round aboutThen they brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said God save the kingNow when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the LORDAnd she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise Then Athaliah rent her clothes and said Treason TreasonThen Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them Have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword For the priest said Slay her not in the house of the LORDSo they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the kings house they slew her thereAnd Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the LORDs peopleThen all the people went to the house of Baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altarsAlso Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD as it is written in the law of Moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by DavidAnd he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD that none which was unclean in any thing should enter inAnd he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the LORD and they came through the high gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdomAnd all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain Athaliah with the swordJoash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Zibiah of Beer-shebaAnd Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priestAnd Jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughtersAnd it came to pass after this that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORDAnd he gathered together the priests and the Levites and said to them Go out unto the cities of Judah and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter Howbeit the Levites hastened it notAnd the king called for Jehoiada the chief and said unto him Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD and of the congregation of Israel for the tabernacle of witnessFor the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of God and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon BaalimAnd at the kings commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORDAnd they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wildernessAnd all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an endNow it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the kings office by the hand of the Levites and when they saw that there was much money the kings scribe and the high priests officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundanceAnd the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORDSo the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of God in his state and strengthened itAnd when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of JehoiadaBut Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he diedAnd they buried him in the city of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel both toward God and toward his houseNow after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and made obeisance to the king Then the king hearkened unto themAnd they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespassYet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the LORD and they testified against them but they would not give earAnd the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them Thus saith God Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the LORD he hath also forsaken youAnd they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORDThus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son And when he died he said The LORD look upon it and require itAnd it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of Syria came up against him and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of DamascusFor the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers So they executed judgment against JoashAnd when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of David but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kingsAnd these are they that conspired against him Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a MoabitessNow concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of God behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings And Amaziah his son reigned in his steadAmaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Jehoaddan of JerusalemAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD but not with a perfect heartNow it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his fatherBut he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses where the LORD commanded saying The fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sinMoreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all Judah and Benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shieldHe hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silverBut there came a man of God to him saying O king let not the army of Israel go with thee for the LORD is not with Israel to wit with all the children of EphraimBut if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle God shall make thee fall before the enemy for God hath power to help and to cast downAnd Amaziah said to the man of God But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel And the man of God answered The LORD is able to give thee much more than thisThen Amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of Ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah and they returned home in great angerAnd Amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the chidren of Seir ten thousandAnd other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in piecesBut the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria even unto Beth-horon and smote three thousand of them and took much spoilNow it came to pass after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites that he brought the gods of the children of Seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto themWherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine handAnd it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him Art thou made of the kings counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten Then the prophet forbare and said I know that God hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counselThen Amaziah king of Judah took advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us see one another in the faceAnd Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon saying Give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode down the thistleThou sayest Lo thou hast smitten the Edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and Judah with theeBut Amaziah would not hear for it came of God that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of EdomSo Joash the king of Israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and Amaziah king of Judah at Beth-shemesh which belongeth to JudahAnd Judah was put to the worse before Israel and they fled every man to his tentAnd Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz at Beth-shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubitsAnd he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom and the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to SamariaAnd Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen yearsNow the rest of the acts of Amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and IsraelNow after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish but they sent to Lachish after him and slew him thereAnd they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of JudahThen all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father AmaziahHe built Eloth and restored it to Judah after that the king slept with his fathersSixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Jecoliah of JerusalemAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Amaziah didAnd he sought God in the days of Zechariah who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he sought the LORD God made him to prosperAnd he went forth and warred against the Philistines and brake down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod and built cities about Ashdod and among the PhilistinesAnd God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal and the MehunimsAnd the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt for he strengthened himself exceedinglyMoreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified themAlso he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in Carmel for he loved husbandryMoreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler under the hand of Hananiah one of the kings captainsThe whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundredAnd under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemyAnd Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stonesAnd he made in Jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal And his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strongBut when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the LORD his God and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incenseAnd Azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the LORD that were valiant menAnd they withstood Uzziah the king and said unto him It appertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn incense unto the LORD but to the priests the sons of Aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD GodThen Uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD from beside the incense altarAnd Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the LORD had smitten himAnd Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the LORD and Jotham his son was over the kings house judging the people of the landNow the rest of the acts of Uzziah first and last did Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz writeSo Uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for they said He is a leper and Jotham his son reigned in his steadJotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Jerushah the daughter of ZadokAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah did howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD And the people did yet corruptlyHe built the high gate of the house of the LORD and on the wall of Ophel he built muchMoreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah and in the forests he built castles and towersHe fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him both the second year and the thirdSo Jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the LORD his GodNow the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and JudahHe was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in JerusalemAnd Jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David and Ahaz his son reigned in his steadAhaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD like David his fatherFor he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and made also molten images for BaalimMoreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of IsraelHe sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green treeWherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to Damascus And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel who smote him with a great slaughterFor Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathersAnd Zichri a mighty man of Ephraim slew Maaseiah the kings son and Azrikam the governor of the house and Elkanah that was next to the kingAnd the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to SamariaBut a prophet of the LORD was there whose name was Oded and he went out before the host that came to Samaria and said unto them Behold because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heavenAnd now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the LORD your GodNow hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon youThen certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim Azariah the son of Johanan Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum and Amasa the son of Hadlai stood up against them that came from the warAnd said unto them Ye shall not bring in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the LORD already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against IsraelSo the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregationAnd the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to Jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to SamariaAt that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help himFor again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah and carried away captivesThe Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of Judah and had taken Beth-shemesh and Ajalon and Gederoth and Shocho with the villages thereof and Timnah with the villages thereof Gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt thereFor the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel for he made Judah naked and transgressed sore against the LORDAnd Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him notFor Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of Assyria but he helped him notAnd in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD this is that king AhazFor he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus which smote him and he said Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them therefore will I sacrifice to them that they may help me But they were the ruin of him and of all IsraelAnd Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD and he made him altars in every corner of JerusalemAnd in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathersNow the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and IsraelAnd Ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in Jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel and Hezekiah his son reigned in his steadHezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Abijah the daughter of ZechariahAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that David his father had doneHe in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired themAnd he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the east streetAnd said unto them Hear me ye Levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy placeFor our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backsAlso they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of IsraelWherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyesFor lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for thisNow it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from usMy sons be not now negligent for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incenseThen the Levites arose Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of Merari Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehalelel and of the Gershonites Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of JoahAnd of the sons of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeiel and of the sons of Asaph Zechariah and MattaniahAnd of the sons of Heman Jehiel and Shimei and of the sons of Jeduthun Shemaiah and UzzielAnd they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD to cleanse the house of the LORDAnd the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD And the Levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook KidronNow they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an endThen they went in to Hezekiah the king and said We have cleansed all the house of the LORD and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereofMoreover all the vessels which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the LORDThen Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the LORDAnd they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORDSo they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altarAnd they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon themAnd the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all Israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all IsraelAnd he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of David and of Gad the kings seer and Nathan the prophet for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophetsAnd the Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpetsAnd Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar And when the burnt offering began the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by David king of IsraelAnd all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finishedAnd when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshippedMoreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer And they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshippedThen Hezekiah answered and said Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offeringsAnd the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the LORDAnd the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheepBut the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priestsAnd also the burnt offerings were in abundancewith the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering So the service of the house of the LORD was set in orderAnd Hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that God had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenlyAnd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the passover unto the LORD God of IsraelFor the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem to keep the passover in the second monthFor they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to JerusalemAnd the thing pleased the king and all the congregationSo they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was writtenSo the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah and according to the commandment of the king saying Ye children of Israel turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham Isaac and Israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of AssyriaAnd be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye seeNow be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the LORD and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the LORD your God that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from youFor if ye turn again unto the LORD your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto himSo the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked themNevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to JerusalemAlso in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the LORDAnd there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregationAnd they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook KidronThen they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the Levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORDAnd they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the LevitesFor there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the LORDFor a multitude of the people even many of Ephraim and Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written But Hezekiah prayed for them saying The good LORD pardon every oneThat prepareth his heart to seek God the LORD God of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuaryAnd the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the peopleAnd the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day singing with loud instruments unto the LORDAnd Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathersAnd the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladnessFor Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselvesAnd all the congregation of Judah with the priests and the Levites and all the congregation that came out of Israel and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel and that dwelt in Judah rejoicedSo there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in JerusalemThen the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heavenNow when all this was finished all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin in Ephraim also and Manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all Then all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession into their own citiesAnd Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORDHe appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the LORDMoreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORDAnd as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the fields and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantlyAnd concerning the children of Israel and Judah that dwelt in the cities of Judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God and laid them by heapsIn the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh monthAnd when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the LORD and his people IsraelThen Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heapsAnd Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him and said Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the LORD hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great storeThen Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD and they prepared themAnd brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler and Shimei his brother was the nextAnd Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of GodAnd Kore the son of Imnah the Levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of God to distribute the oblations of the LORD and the most holy thingsAnd next him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah Amariah and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the smallBeside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their coursesBoth to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the Levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their coursesAnd to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holinessAlso of the sons of Aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the LevitesAnd thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his GodAnd in every work that he began in the service of the house of God and in the law and in the commandments to seek his God he did it with all his heart and prosperedAfter these things and the establishment thereof Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himselfAnd when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against JerusalemHe took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help himSo there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much waterAlso he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired Millo in the city of David and made darts and shields in abundanceAnd he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them sayingBe strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with himWith him is an arm of flesh but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of JudahAfter this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem but he himself laid siege against Lachish and all his power with him unto Hezekiah king of Judah and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem sayingThus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria Whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in JerusalemDoth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst saying The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of AssyriaHath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying Ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon itKnow ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine handWho was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine handNow therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine handAnd his servants spake yet more against the LORD God and against his servant HezekiahHe wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel and to speak against him saying As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine handThen they cried with a loud voice in the Jews speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the cityAnd they spake against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of manAnd for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heavenAnd the LORD sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria So he returned with shame of face to his own land And when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the swordThus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every sideAnd many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforthIn those days Hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the LORD and he spake unto him and he gave him a signBut Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon Judah and JerusalemNotwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of HezekiahAnd Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant jewelsStorehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocksMoreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for God had given him substance very muchThis same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David And Hezekiah prospered in all his worksHowbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heartNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz and in the book of the kings of Judah and IsraelAnd Hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death And Manasseh his son reigned in his steadManasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in JerusalemBut did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD like unto the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of IsraelFor he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for Baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of heaven and served themAlso he built altars in the house of the LORD whereof the LORD had said In Jerusalem shall my name be for everAnd he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORDAnd he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to angerAnd he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel will I put my name for everNeither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of MosesSo Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of IsraelAnd the LORD spake to Manasseh and to his people but they would not hearkenWherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria which took Manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to BabylonAnd when he was in affliction he besought the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathersAnd prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was GodNow after this he built a wall without the city of David on the west side of Gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about Ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of JudahAnd he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the LORD and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem and cast them out of the cityAnd he repaired the altar of the LORD and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of IsraelNevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the LORD their God onlyNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer unto his God and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of IsraelHis prayer also and how God was intreated of him and all his sin and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seersSo Manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and Amon his son reigned in his steadAmon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in JerusalemBut he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD as did Manasseh his father for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made and served themAnd humbled not himself before the LORD as Manasseh his father had humbled himself but Amon trespassed more and moreAnd his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own houseBut the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his steadJosiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty yearsAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the leftFor in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the God of David his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten imagesAnd they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto themAnd he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed Judah and JerusalemAnd so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon even unto Naphtali with their mattocks round aboutAnd when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel he returned to JerusalemNow in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the LORD his GodAnd when they came to Hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim and of all the remnant of Israel and of all Judah and Benjamin and they returned to JerusalemAnd they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD to repair and amend the houseEven to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyedAnd the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites of the sons of Merari and Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites to set it forward and other of the Levites all that could skill of instruments of musickAlso they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the Levites there were scribes and officers and portersAnd when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by MosesAnd Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD And Hilkiah delivered the book to ShaphanAnd Shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again saying All that was committed to thy servants they do itAnd they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmenThen Shaphan the scribe told the king saying Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book And Shaphan read it before the kingAnd it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothesAnd the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Abdon the son of Micah and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah a servant of the kings sayingGo inquire of the LORD for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD to do after all that is written in this bookAnd Hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath the son of Hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effectAnd she answered them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Tell ye the man that sent you to meThus saith the LORD Behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of JudahBecause they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenchedAnd as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD so shall ye say unto him Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heardBecause thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before God when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me I have even heard thee also saith the LORDBehold I will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same So they brought the king word againThen the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and JerusalemAnd the king went up into the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORDAnd the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this bookAnd he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God the God of their fathersAnd Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel and made all that were present in Israel to serve even to serve the LORD their God And all his days they departed not from following the LORD the God of their fathersMoreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first monthAnd he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORDAnd said unto the Levites that taught all Israel which were holy unto the LORD Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the LORD your God and his people IsraelAnd prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of Solomon his sonAnd stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the division of the families of the LevitesSo kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of MosesAnd Josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the kings substanceAnd his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the Levites Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel rulers of the house of God gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxenConaniah also and Shemaiah and Nethaneel his brethren and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad chief of the Levites gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxenSo the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their courses according to the kings commandmentAnd they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands and the Levites flayed themAnd they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the LORD as it is written in the book of Moses And so did they with the oxenAnd they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the peopleAnd afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of AaronAnd the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the kings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the Levites prepared for themSo all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD according to the commandment of king JosiahAnd the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven daysAnd there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were present and the inhabitants of JerusalemIn the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover keptAfter all this when Josiah had prepared the temple Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates and Josiah went out against himBut he sent ambassadors to him saying What have I to do with thee thou king of Judah I come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith I have war for God commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me that he destroy thee notNevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God and came to fight in the valley of MegiddoAnd the archers shot at king Josiah and the king said to his servants Have me away for I am sore woundedHis servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to Jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for JosiahAnd Jeremiah lamented for Josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in Israel and behold they are written in the lamentationsNow the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the LORDAnd his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and JudahThen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in his fathers stead in JerusalemJehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in JerusalemAnd the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of goldAnd the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem and turned his name to Jehoiakim And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to EgyptJehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his GodAgainst him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to BabylonNebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his temple at BabylonNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his steadJehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORDAnd when the year was expired king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and JerusalemZedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in JerusalemAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORDAnd he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by God but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of IsraelMoreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in JerusalemAnd the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling placeBut they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people till there was no remedyTherefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his handAnd all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to BabylonAnd they burnt the house of God and brake down the wall of Jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereofAnd them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of PersiaTo fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten yearsNow in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing sayingThus saith Cyrus king of Persia All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah Who is there among you of all his people The LORD his God be with him and let him go upNow in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing sayingThus saith Cyrus king of Persia The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem which is in JudahWho is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the LORD God of Israel he is the God which is in JerusalemAnd whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in JerusalemThen rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all them whose spirit God had raised to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in JerusalemAnd all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with precious things beside all that was willingly offeredAlso Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his godsEven those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar the prince of JudahAnd this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knivesThirty basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels a thousandAll the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto JerusalemNow these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those which had been carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah every one unto his cityWhich

there stood up a priest with Urim and with ThummimThe whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescoreBeside their servants and their maids of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing womenTheir horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and fiveTheir

for the house of God to set it up in his placeThey gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garmentsSo the priests and the Levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the Nethinims dwelt in their cities and all Israel in their citiesAnd when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to JerusalemThen stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of GodAnd they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD even burnt offerings morning and eveningThey kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom as the duty of every day requiredAnd afterward offered the continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORDFrom the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laidThey gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon and to them of Tyre to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of PersiaNow in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the LORDThen stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren Kadmiel and his sons the sons of Judah together to set forward the workmen in the house of God the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the LevitesAnd when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals to praise the LORD after the ordinance of David king of IsraelAnd they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laidBut many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joySo that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar offNow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of IsraelThen they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them Let us build with you for we seek your God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur which brought us up hitherBut Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded usThen the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in buildingAnd hired counsellers against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia even until the reign of Darius king of PersiaAnd in the reign of Ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and JerusalemAnd in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam Mithredath Tabeel and the rest of their companions unto Artaxerxes king of Persia and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue and interpreted in the Syrian tongueRehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sortThen wrote Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the Dinaites the Apharsathchites the Tarpelites the Apharsites the Archevites the Babylonians the Susanchites the Dehavites and the ElamitesAnd the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over and set in the cities of Samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a timeThis is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto Artaxerxes the king Thy servants the men on this side the river and at such a timeBe it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundationsBe it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kingsNow because we have maintenance from the kings palace and it was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the kingThat search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyedWe certify the king that if this city be builded again and the walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the riverThen sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor and to Shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria and unto the rest beyond the river Peace and at such a timeThe letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before meAnd I commanded and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made thereinThere have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto themGive ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given from meTake heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow to the hurt of the kingsNow when the copy of king Artaxerxes letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them to cease by force and powerThen ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of PersiaThen the prophets Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel even unto themThen rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping themAt the same time came to them Tatnai governor on this side the river and Shethar-boznai and their companions and said thus unto them Who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wallThen said we unto them after this manner What are the names of the men that make this buildingBut the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to Darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matterThe copy of the letter that Tatnai governor on this side the river and Shethar-boznai and his companions the Apharsachites which were on this side the river sent unto Darius the kingThey sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus Unto Darius the king all peaceBe it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their handsThen asked we those elders and said unto them thus Who commanded you to build this house and to make up these wallsWe asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of themAnd thus they returned us answer saying We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of Israel builded and set upBut after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into BabylonBut in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of GodAnd the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the temple of Babylon those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar whom he had made governorAnd said unto him Take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be builded in his placeThen came the same Sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not finishedNow therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the kings treasure house which is there at Babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matterThen Darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in BabylonAnd there was found at Achmetha in the palace that is in the province of the Medes a roll and therein was a record thus writtenIn the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem Let the house be builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubitsWith three rows of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expences be given out of the kings houseAnd also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem every one to his place and place them in the house of GodNow therefore Tatnai governor beyond the river Shethar-boznai and your companions the Apharsachites which are beyond the river be ye far from thenceLet the work of this house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his placeMoreover I made a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God that of the kings goods even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expences be given unto these men that they be not hinderedAnd that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without failThat they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sonsAlso I have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for thisAnd the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree let it be done with speedThen Tatnai governor on this side the river Shethar-boznai and their companions according to that which Darius the king had sent so they did speedilyAnd the elders of the Jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo And they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the God of Israel and according to the commandment of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of PersiaAnd this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the kingAnd the children of Israel the priests and the Levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of God with joyAnd offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all Israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes of IsraelAnd they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God which is at Jerusalem as it is written in the book of MosesAnd the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first monthFor the priests and the Levites were purified together all of them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselvesAnd the children of Israel which were come again out of captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the LORD God of Israel did eatAnd kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God the God of IsraelNow after these things in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia Ezra the son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of HilkiahThe son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of AhitubThe son of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of MeraiothThe son of Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of BukkiThe son of Abishua the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priestThis Ezra went up from Babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses which the LORD God of Israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of the LORD his God upon himAnd there went up some of the children of Israel and of the priests and the Levites and the singers and the porters and the Nethinims unto Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the kingAnd he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the kingFor upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon himFor Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgmentsNow this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD and of his statutes to IsraelArtaxerxes king of kings unto Ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the God of heaven perfect peace and at such a timeI make a decree that all they of the people of Israel and of his priests and Levites in my realm which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem go with theeForasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven counsellers to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of thy God which is in thine handAnd to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel whose habitation is in JerusalemAnd all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their God which is in JerusalemThat thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in JerusalemAnd whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of your GodThe vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God those deliver thou before the God of JerusalemAnd whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the kings treasure houseAnd I even I Artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever Ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the God of heaven shall require of you it be done speedilyUnto an hundred talents of silver and to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how muchWhatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sonsAlso we certify you that touching any of the priests and Levites singers porters Nethinims or ministers of this house of God it shall not be lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon themAnd thou Ezra after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy God and teach ye them that know them notAnd whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonmentBlessed be the LORD God of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this in the kings heart to beautify the house of the LORD which is in JerusalemAnd hath extended mercy unto me before the king and his counsellers and before all the kings mighty princes And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with meThese are now the chief of their fathers and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes the kingOf the sons of Phinehas Gershom of the sons of Ithamar Daniel of the sons of David HattushOf the sons of Shechaniah of the sons of Pharosh Zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fiftyOf the sons of Pahath-moab Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah and with him two hundred malesOf the sons of Shechaniah the son of Jahaziel and with him three hundred malesOf the sons also of Adin Ebed the son of Jonathan and with him fifty malesAnd of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and with him seventy malesAnd of the sons of Shephatiah Zebadiah the son of Michael and with him fourscore malesOf the sons of Joab Obadiah the son of Jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen malesAnd of the sons of Shelomith the son of Josiphiah and with him an hundred and threescore malesAnd of the sons of Bebai Zechariah the son of Bebai and with him twenty and eight malesAnd of the sons of Azgad Johanan the son of Hakkatan and with him an hundred and ten malesAnd of the last sons of Adonikam whose names are these Eliphelet Jeiel and Shemaiah and with them threescore malesOf the sons also of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud and with them seventy malesAnd I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava and there abode we in tents three days and I viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of LeviThen sent I for Eliezer for Ariel for Shemaiah and for Elnathan and for Jarib and for Elnathan and for Nathan and for Zechariah and for Meshullam chief men also for Joiarib and for Elnathan men of understandingAnd I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia and I told them what they should say unto Iddo and to his brethren the Nethinims at the place Casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our GodAnd by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi the son of Israel and Sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteenAnd Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari his brethren and their sons twentyAlso of the Nethinims whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites two hundred and twenty Nethinims all of them were expressed by nameThen I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our God to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substanceFor I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake himSo we fasted and besought our God for this and he was intreated of usThen I separated twelve of the chief of the priests Sherebiah Hashabiah and ten of their brethren with themAnd weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of the house of our God which the king and his counsellers and his lords and all Israel there present had offeredI even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talentsAlso twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine copper precious as goldAnd I said unto them Ye are holy unto the LORD the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathersWatch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites and chief of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the LORDSo took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our GodThen we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto Jerusalem and the hand of our God was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the wayAnd we came to Jerusalem and abode there three daysNow on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui LevitesBy number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that timeAlso the children of those that had been carried away which were come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel twelve bullocks for all Israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering unto the LORDAnd they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they furthered the people and the house of GodNow when these things were done the princes came to me saying The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the Canaanites the Hittites the Perizzites the Jebusites the Ammonites the Moabites the Egyptians and the AmoritesFor they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespassAnd when I heard this thing I rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astoniedThen were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and I sat astonied until the evening sacrificeAnd at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the LORD my GodAnd said O my God I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my God for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavensSince the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this dayAnd now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our God may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondageFor we were bondmen yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our God and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in Judah and in JerusalemAnd now O our God what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandmentsWhich thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying The land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleannessNow therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for everAnd after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as thisShould we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escapingO LORD God of Israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of thisNow when Ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of God there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very soreAnd Shechaniah the son of Jehiel one of the sons of Elam answered and said unto Ezra We have trespassed against our God and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thingNow therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God and let it be done according to the lawArise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do itThen arose Ezra and made the chief priests the Levites and all Israel to swear that they should do according to this word And they swareThen Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried awayAnd they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto JerusalemAnd that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried awayThen all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days It was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of God trembling because of this matter and for the great rainAnd Ezra the priest stood up and said unto them Ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of IsraelNow therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wivesThen all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice As thou hast said so must we doBut the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thingLet now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from usOnly Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped themAnd the children of the captivity did so And Ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matterAnd they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first monthAnd among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and GedaliahAnd they gave their hands that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespassAnd of the sons of Immer Hanani and ZebadiahAnd of the sons of Harim Maaseiah and Elijah and Shemaiah and Jehiel and UzziahAnd of the sons of Pashur Elioenai Maaseiah Ishmael Nethaneel Jozabad and ElasahAlso of the Levites Jozabad and Shimei and Kelaiah the same is Kelita Pethahiah Judah and EliezerOf the singers also Eliashib and of the porters Shallum and Telem and UriMoreover of Israel of the sons of Parosh Ramiah and Jeziah and Malchiah and Miamin and Eleazar and Malchijah and BenaiahAnd of the sons of Elam Mattaniah Zechariah and Jehiel and Abdi and Jeremoth and EliahAnd of the sons of Zattu Elioenai Eliashib Mattaniah and Jeremoth and Zabad and AzizaOf the sons also of Bebai Jehohanan Hananiah Zabbai and AthlaiAnd of the sons of Bani Meshullam Malluch and Adaiah Jashub and Sheal and RamothAnd of the sons of Pahath-moab Adna and Chelal Benaiah Maaseiah Mattaniah Bezaleel and Binnui and ManassehAnd of the sons of Harim Eliezer Ishijah Malchiah Shemaiah ShimeonBenjamin Malluch and ShemariahOf the sons of Hashum Mattenai Mattathah Zabad Eliphelet Jeremai Manasseh and ShimeiOf the sons of Bani Maadai Amram and UelBenaiah Bedeiah ChelluhVaniah Meremoth EliashibMattaniah Mattenai and JaasauAnd Bani and Binnui ShimeiAnd Shelemiah and Nathan and AdaiahMachnadebai Shashai SharaiAzareel and Shelemiah ShemariahShallum Amariah and JosephOf the sons of Nebo Jeiel Mattithiah Zabad Zebina Jadau and Joel BenaiahAll these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had childrenThe words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah And it came to pass in the month Chisleu in the twentieth year as I was in Shushan the palaceThat Hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning JerusalemAnd they said unto me The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fireAnd it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heavenAnd said I beseech thee O LORD God of heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandmentsLet thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my fathers house have sinnedWe have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant MosesRemember I beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses saying If ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the nationsBut if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will I gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name thereNow these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong handO Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man For I was the kings cupbearerAnd it came to pass in the month Nisan in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presenceWherefore the king said unto me Why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart Then I was very sore afraidAnd said unto the king Let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fireThen the king said unto me For what dost thou make request So I prayed to the God of heavenAnd I said unto the king If it please the king and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto Judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that I may build itAnd the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him For how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return So it pleased the king to send me and I set him a timeMoreover I said unto the king If it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come into JudahAnd a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into And the king granted me according to the good hand of my God upon meThen I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the kings letters Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with meWhen Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of IsraelSo I came to Jerusalem and was there three daysAnd I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that I rode uponAnd I went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fireThen I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kings pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to passThen went I up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returnedAnd the rulers knew not whither I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the workThen said I unto them Ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproachThen I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the kings words that he had spoken unto me And they said Let us rise up and build So they strengthened their hands for this good workBut when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite and

between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchantsBut it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the JewsAnd he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said What do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burnedNow Tobiah the Ammonite was by him and he said Even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wallHear O our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivityAnd cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the buildersSo built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to workBut it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wrothAnd conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder itNevertheless we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and night because of themAnd Judah said The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wallAnd our adversaries said They shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to ceaseAnd it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon youTherefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bowsAnd I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people Be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your housesAnd it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to nought that we returned all of us to the wall every one unto his workAnd it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers were behind all the house of JudahThey which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weaponFor the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and so builded And he that sounded the trumpet was by meAnd I said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people The work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from anotherIn what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto us our God shall fight for usSo we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appearedLikewise at the same time said I unto the people Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and labour on the daySo neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that every one put them off for washingAnd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the JewsFor there were that said We our sons and our daughters are many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and liveSome also there were that said We have mortgaged our lands vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearthThere were also that said We have borrowed money for the kings tribute and that upon our lands and vineyardsYet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyardsAnd I was very angry when I heard their cry and these wordsThen I consulted with myself and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them Ye exact usury every one of his brother And I set a great assembly against themAnd I said unto them We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us Then held they their peace and found nothing to answerAlso I said It is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemiesI likewise and my brethren and my servants might exact of them money and corn I pray you let us leave off this usuryRestore I pray you to them even this day their lands their vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the the hundredth part of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of themThen said they We will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest Then I called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promiseAlso I shook my lap and said So God shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied And all the congregation said Amen and praised the LORD And the people did according to this promiseMoreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king that is twelve years I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governorBut the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not I because of the fear of GodYea also I continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the workMoreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about usNow that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this peopleThink upon me my God for good according to all that I have done for this peopleNow it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gatesThat Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me saying Come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono But they thought to do me mischiefAnd I sent messengers unto them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to youYet they sent unto me four times after this sort and I answered them after the same mannerThen sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his handWherein was written It is reported among the heathen and Gashmu saith it that thou and the Jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these wordsAnd thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem saying There is a king in Judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words Come now therefore and let us take counsel togetherThen I sent unto him saying There are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heartFor they all made us afraid saying Their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done Now therefore O God strengthen my handsAfterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel who was shut up and he said Let us meet together in the house of God within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay theeAnd I said Should such a man as I flee and who is there that being as I am would go into the temple to save his life I will not go inAnd lo I perceived that God had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired himTherefore was he hired that I should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach meMy God think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fearSo the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul in fifty and two daysAnd it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our GodMoreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah and the letters of Tobiah came unto themFor there were many in Judah sworn unto him because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of BerechiahAlso they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fearNow it came to pass when the wall was built and I had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointedThat I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over Jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared God above manyAnd I said unto them Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his houseNow the city was large and great but the people were few therein and the houses were not buildedAnd my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written thereinThese are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah every one unto

were they which went up also from Telmelah Telharesha Cherub Addon and Immer but they could not shew their fathers house nor their seed whether they were of IsraelThe children of Delaiah the children of Tobiah the children of Nekoda six hundred forty and twoAnd of the priests the children of Habaiah the children of Koz the children of Barzillai which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife and was called after their nameThese sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but it was not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthoodAnd the Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with Urim and ThummimThe whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescoreBeside their manservants and their maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing womenTheir horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and fiveTheir camels four hundred thirty and five six thousand seven hundred and twenty assesAnd some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons five hundred and thirty priests garmentsAnd some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred pound of silverAnd that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and seven priests garmentsSo the priests and the Levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the Nethinims and all Israel dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children of Israel were in their citiesAnd all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had commanded to IsraelAnd Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh monthAnd he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the lawAnd Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Urijah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchiah and Hashum and Hashbadana Zechariah and MeshullamAnd Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood upAnd Ezra blessed the LORD the great God And all the people answered Amen Amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the groundAlso Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah Jamin Akkub Shabbethai Hodijah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan Pelaiah and the Levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their placeSo they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the readingAnd Nehemiah which is the Tirshatha and Ezra the priest the scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people This day is holy unto the LORD your God mourn not nor weep For all the people wept when they heard the words of the lawThen he said unto them Go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our Lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the LORD is your strengthSo the Levites stilled all the people saying Hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grievedAnd all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto themAnd on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the Levites unto Ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the lawAnd they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh monthAnd that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem saying Go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is writtenSo the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God and in the street of the water gate and in the street of the gate of EphraimAnd all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so And there was very great gladnessAlso day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of God And they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the mannerNow in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth upon themAnd the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathersAnd they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the LORD their GodThen stood up upon the stairs of the Levites Jeshua and Bani Kadmiel Shebaniah Bunni Sherebiah Bani and Chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their GodThen the Levites Jeshua and Kadmiel Bani Hashabniah Sherebiah Hodijah Shebaniah and Pethahiah said Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praiseThou even thou art LORD alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth theeThou art the LORD the God who didst choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees and gavest him the name of AbrahamAnd foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites the Hittites the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Jebusites and the Girgashites to give it I say to his seed and hast performed thy words for thou art righteousAnd didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heardest their cry by the Red seaAnd shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharoah and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them So didst thou get thee a name as it is this dayAnd thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty watersMoreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should goThou camest down also upon mount Sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good statutes and commandmentsAnd madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the hand of Moses thy servantAnd gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give themBut they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandmentsAnd refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou art a God ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them notYea when they had made them a molten calf and said This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt and had wrought great provocationsYet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to shew them light and the way wherein they should goThou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirstYea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled notMoreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide them into corners so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of BashanTheir children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess itSo the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they wouldAnd they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodnessNevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocationsTherefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemiesBut after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy merciesAnd testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hearYet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the landsNevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful GodNow therefore our God the great the mighty and the terrible God who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this dayHowbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou hast done right but we have done wickedlyNeither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against themFor they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked worksBehold we are servants this day and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in itAnd it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distressAnd because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes Levites and priests seal unto itNow those that sealed were Nehemiah the Tirshatha the son of Hachaliah and ZidkijahSeraiah Azariah JeremiahPashur Amariah MalchijahHattush Shebaniah MalluchHarim Meremoth

the lands unto the law of God their wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge and having understandingThey clave to their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in Gods law which was given by Moses the servant of God and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord and his judgments and his statutesAnd that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land nor take their daughters for our sonsAnd if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the exaction of every debtAlso we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our GodFor the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel and for all the work of the house of our GodAnd we cast the lots among the priests the Levites and the people for the wood offering to bring it into the house of our God after the houses of our fathers at times appointed year by year to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God as it is written in the lawAnd to bring the firstfruits of our

gatesThese were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest the scribeAnd at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with singing with cymbals psalteries and with harpsAnd the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem and from the villages of NetophathiAlso from the house of Gilgal and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages round about JerusalemAnd the priests and the Levites purified themselves and purified the people and the gates and the wallThen I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gateAnd after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of JudahAnd Azariah Ezra and MeshullamJudah and Benjamin and Shemaiah and JeremiahAnd certain of the priests sons with trumpets namely Zechariah the son of Jonathan the son of Shemaiah the

man of God and Ezra the scribe before themAnd at the fountain gate which was over against them they went up by the stairs of the city of David at the going up of the wall above the house of David even unto the water gate eastwardAnd the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them and I after them and the half of the people upon the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wallAnd from above the gate of Ephraim and above the old gate and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel and the tower of Meah even unto the sheep gate and they stood still in

Hananiah with trumpetsAnd Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer And the singers sang loud with Jezrahiah their overseerAlso that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for God had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar offAnd at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waitedAnd both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his sonFor in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto GodAnd all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of AaronOn that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for everBecause they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water but hired Balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessingNow it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitudeAnd before this Eliashib the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God was allied unto TobiahAnd he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the Levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priestsBut in all this time was not I at Jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king and after certain days obtained I leave of the kingAnd I came to Jerusalem and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of GodAnd it grieved me sore therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamberThen I commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God with the meat offering and the frankincenseAnd I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them for the Levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his fieldThen contended I with the rulers and said Why is the house of God forsaken And I gathered them together and set them in their placeThen brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuriesAnd I made treasurers over the treasuries Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe and of the Levites Pedaiah and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethrenRemember me O my God concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for the offices thereofIn those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victualsThere dwelt men of Tyre also therein which brought fish and all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah and in JerusalemThen I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them What evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath dayDid not your fathers thus and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbathAnd it came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath I commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set I at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath daySo the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twiceThen I testified against them and said unto them Why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again I will lay hands on you From that time forth came they no more on the sabbathAnd I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day Remember me O my God concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercyIn those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod of Ammon and of MoabAnd their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod and could not speak in the Jews language but according to the language of each peopleAnd I contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by God saying Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselvesDid not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his God and God made him king over all Israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sinShall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our God in marrying strange wivesAnd one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite therefore I chased him from meRemember them O my God because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the LevitesThus cleansed I them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites every one in his businessAnd for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits Remember me O my God for goodNow it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus this is Ahasuerus which reigned from India even unto Ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provincesThat in those days when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in Shushan the palaceIn the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of Persia and Media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before himWhen he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore daysAnd when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings palaceWhere were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marbleAnd they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the kingAnd the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every mans pleasureAlso Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king AhasuerusOn the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded Mehuman Biztha Harbona Bigtha and Abagtha Zethar and Carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the kingTo bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look onBut the queen Vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in himThen the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgmentAnd the next unto him was Carshena Shethar Admatha Tarshish Meres Marsena and Memucan the seven princes of Persia and Media which saw the kings face and which sat the first in the kingdomWhat shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlainsAnd Memucan answered before the king and the princes Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king AhasuerusFor this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came notLikewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrathIf it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes that it be not altered That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than sheAnd when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and smallAnd the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of MemucanFor he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every peopleAfter these things when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against herThen said the kings servants that ministered unto him Let there be fair young virgins sought for the kingAnd let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the kings chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given themAnd let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti And the thing pleased the king and he did soNow in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish a BenjamiteWho had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried awayAnd he brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncles daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughterSo it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace to the custody of Hegai that Esther was brought also unto the kings house to the custody of Hegai keeper of the womenAnd the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the kings house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the womenEsther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew itAnd Mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens house to know how Esther did and what should become of herNow when every maids turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the womenThen thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings houseIn the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz the kings chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by nameNow when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what Hegai the kings chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon herSo Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth in the seventh year of his reignAnd the king loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of VashtiThen the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even Esthers feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the kingAnd when the virgins were gathered together the second time then Mordecai sat in the kings gateEsther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as Mordecai had charged her for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with himIn those days while Mordecai sat in the kings gate two of the kings chamberlains Bigthan and Teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king AhasuerusAnd the thing was known to Mordecai who told it unto Esther the queen and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecais nameAnd when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the kingAfter these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with himAnd all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowed and reverenced Haman for the king had so commanded concerning him But Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverenceThen the kings servants which were in the kings gate said unto Mordecai Why transgressest thou the kings commandmentNow it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told Haman to see whether Mordecais matters would stand for he had told them that he was a JewAnd when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was Haman full of wrathAnd he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus even the people of MordecaiIn the first month that is the month Nisan in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus they cast Pur that is the lot before Haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month AdarAnd Haman said unto king Ahasuerus There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profit to suffer themIf it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the kings treasuriesAnd the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the Jews enemyAnd the king said unto Haman The silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to theeThen were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written and sealed with the kings ringAnd the letters were sent by posts into all the kings provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month Adar and to take the spoil of them for a preyThe copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that dayThe posts went out being hastened by the kings commandment and the decree was given in Shushan the palace And the king and Haman sat down to drink but the city Shushan was perplexedWhen Mordecai perceived all that was done Mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cryAnd came even before the kings gate for none might enter into the kings gate clothed with sackclothAnd in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashesSo Esthers maids and her chamberlains came and told it her Then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it notThen called Esther for Hatach one of the kings chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to Mordecai to know what it was and why it wasSo Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the kings gateAnd Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the Jews to destroy themAlso he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them to shew it unto Esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her peopleAnd Hatach came and told Esther the words of MordecaiAgain Esther spake unto Hatach and gave him commandment unto MordecaiAll the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty daysAnd they told to Mordecai Esthers wordsThen Mordecai commanded to answer Esther Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the JewsFor if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as thisThen Esther bade them return Mordecai this answerGo gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if I perish I perishSo Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded himNow it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the houseAnd it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand So Esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptreThen said the king unto her What wilt thou queen Esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdomAnd Esther answered If it seem good unto the king let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for himThen the king said Cause Haman to make haste that he may do as Esther hath said So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had preparedAnd the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine What is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performedThen answered Esther and said My petition and my request isIf I have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them and I will do tomorrow as the king hath saidThen went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against MordecaiNevertheless Haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wifeAnd Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the kingHaman said moreover Yea Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the kingYet all this availeth me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the kings gateThen said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet And the thing pleased Haman and he caused the gallows to be madeOn that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the kingAnd it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh two of the kings chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king AhasuerusAnd the king said What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this Then said the kings servants that ministered unto him There is nothing done for himAnd the king said Who is in the court Now Haman was come into the outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for himAnd the kings servants said unto him Behold Haman standeth in the court And the king said Let him come inSo Haman came in And the king said unto him What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour Now Haman thought in his heart To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myselfAnd Haman answered the king For the man whom the king delighteth to honourLet the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his headAnd let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honourThen the king said to Haman Make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to Mordecai the Jew that sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou has spokenThen took Haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed Mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honourAnd Mordecai came again to the kings gate But Haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head coveredAnd Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before himAnd while they were yet talking with him came the kings chamberlains and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had preparedSo the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queenAnd the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine What is thy petition queen Esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdomThen Esther the queen answered and said If I have found favour in thy sight O king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my requestFor we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen I had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the kings damageThen the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen Who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do soAnd Esther said The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queenAnd the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the kingThen the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was Then said the king Will he force the queen also before me in the house As the word went out of the kings mouth they covered Hamans faceAnd Harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which Haman had made for Mordecai who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of Haman Then the king said Hang him thereonSo they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai Then was the kings wrath pacifiedOn that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther the queen And Mordecai came before the king for Esther had told what he was unto herAnd the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it unto Mordecai And Esther set Mordecai over the house of HamanAnd Esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite and his device that he had devised against the JewsThen the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther So Esther arose and stood before the kingAnd said If it please the king and if I have found favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and I be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the kings provincesFor how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindredThen the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the JewsWrite ye also for the Jews as it liketh you in the kings name and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverseThen were the kings scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month Sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their languageAnd he wrote in the king Ahasuerus name and sealed it with the kings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedariesWherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a preyUpon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month AdarThe copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemiesSo the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment And the decree was given at Shushan the palaceAnd Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was gladThe Jews had light and gladness and joy and honourAnd in every province and in every city whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came the Jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day And many of the people of the land became Jews for the fear of the Jews fell upon themNow in the twelfth month that is the month Adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the Jews had rule over them that hated themThe Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all peopleAnd all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the Jews because the fear of Mordecai fell upon themFor Mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greaterThus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated themAnd in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred menAnd Parshandatha and Dalphon and AspathaAnd Poratha and Adalia and AridathaAnd Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and VajezathaThe ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the enemy of the Jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their handOn that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the kingAnd the king said unto Esther the queen The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace and the ten sons of Haman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be doneThen said Esther If it please the king let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this days decree and let Hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallowsAnd the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at Shushan and they hanged Hamans ten sonsFor the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar and slew three hundred men at Shushan but on the prey they laid not their handBut the other Jews that were in the kings provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the preyOn the thirteenth day of the month Adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladnessBut the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladnessTherefore the Jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to anotherAnd Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus both nigh and farTo stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearlyAs the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poorAnd the Jews undertook to do as they had begun and as Mordecai had written unto themBecause Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of all the Jews had devised against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy themBut when Esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the Jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallowsWherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur Therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto themThe Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every yearAnd that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seedThen Esther the queen the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of PurimAnd he sent the letters unto all the Jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with words of peace and truthTo confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cryAnd the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim and it was written in the bookAnd the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the seaAnd all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai whereunto the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and PersiaFor Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seedThere was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evilAnd there were born unto him seven sons and three daughtersHis substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the eastAnd his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with themAnd it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for Job said It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts Thus did Job continuallyNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan came also among themAnd the LORD said unto Satan Whence comest thou Then Satan answered the LORD and said From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in itAnd the LORD said unto Satan Hast thou considered my servant Job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and escheweth evilThen Satan answered the LORD and said Doth Job fear God for noughtHast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the landBut put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy faceAnd the LORD said unto Satan Behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORDAnd there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers houseAnd there came a messenger unto Job and said The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside themAnd the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell theeWhile he was yet speaking there came also another and said The fire of God is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped alone to tell theeWhile he was yet speaking there came also another and said The Chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell theeWhile he was yet speaking there came also another and said Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers houseAnd behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell theeThen Job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshippedAnd said Naked came I out of my mothers womb and naked shall I return thither the LORD gave and the LORD hath taken away blessed be the name of the LORDIn all this Job sinned not nor charged God foolishlyAgain there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORDAnd the LORD said unto Satan From whence comest thou And Satan answered the LORD and said From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in itAnd the LORD said unto Satan Hast thou considered my servant Job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and escheweth evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without causeAnd Satan answered the LORD and said Skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his lifeBut put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy faceAnd the LORD said unto Satan Behold he is in thine hand but save his lifeSo went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crownAnd he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat down among the ashesThen said his wife unto him Dost thou still retain thine integrity curse God and dieBut he said unto her Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh What shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil In all this did not Job sin with his lipsNow when Jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort himAnd when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heavenSo they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very greatAfter this opened Job his mouth and cursed his dayAnd Job spake and saidLet the day perish wherein I was born and the night in which it was said There is a man child conceivedLet that day be darkness let not God regard it from above neither let the light shine upon itLet darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify itAs for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of the monthsLo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come thereinLet them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up their mourningLet the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the dayBecause it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb nor hid sorrow from mine eyesWhy died I not from the womb why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the bellyWhy did the knees prevent me or why the breasts that I should suckFor now should I have lain still and been quiet I should have slept then had I been at restWith kings and counsellers of the earth which built desolate places for themselvesOr with princes that had gold who filled their houses with silverOr as an hidden untimely birth I had not been as infants which never saw lightThere the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at restThere the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressorThe small and great are there and the servant is free from his masterWherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soulWhich long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasuresWhich rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the graveWhy is light given to a man whose way is hid and whom God hath hedged inFor my sighing cometh before I eat and my roarings are poured out like the watersFor the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto meI was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble cameThen Eliphaz the Temanite answered and saidIf we assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speakingBehold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak handsThy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast strengthened the feeble kneesBut now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee and thou art troubledIs not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy waysRemember I pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut offEven as I have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the sameBy the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumedThe roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are brokenThe old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lions whelps are scattered abroadNow a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a little thereofIn thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on menFear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shakeThen a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood upIt stood still but I could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and I heard a voice sayingShall mortal man be more just than God shall a man be more pure than his makerBehold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with follyHow much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the mothThey are destroyed from morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding itDoth not their excellency which is in them go away they die even without wisdomCall now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of the saints wilt thou turnFor wrath killeth the foolish man and envy slayeth the silly oneI have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly I cursed his habitationHis children are far from safety and they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver themWhose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substanceAlthough affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the groundYet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upwardI would seek unto God and unto God would I commit my causeWhich doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without numberWho giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fieldsTo set up on high those that be low that those which mourn may be exalted to safetyHe disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterpriseHe taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the froward is carried headlongThey meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the nightBut he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from the hand of the mightySo the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouthBehold happy is the man whom God correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the AlmightyFor he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make wholeHe shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch theeIn famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the swordThou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it comethAt destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earthFor thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with theeAnd thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sinThou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earthThou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn cometh in in his seasonLo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy goodBut Job answered and saidOh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances togetherFor now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed upFor the arrows of the Almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of God do set themselves in array against meDoth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodderCan that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an eggThe things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meatOh that I might have my request and that God would grant me the thing that I long forEven that it would please God to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me offThen should I yet have comfort yea I would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for I have not concealed the words of the Holy OneWhat is my strength that I should hope and what is mine end that I should prolong my lifeIs my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brassIs not my help in me and is wisdom driven quite from meTo him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the AlmightyMy brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass awayWhich are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hidWhat time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their placeThe paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and perishThe troops of Tema looked the companies of Sheba waited for themThey were confounded because they had hoped they came thither and were ashamedFor now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraidDid I say Bring unto me or Give a reward for me of your substanceOr Deliver me from the enemys hand or Redeem me from the hand of the mightyTeach me and I will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein I have erredHow forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reproveDo ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as windYea ye overwhelm the fatherless and ye dig a pit for your friendNow therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto you if I lieReturn I pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my righteousness is in itIs there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse thingsIs there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his days also like the days of an hirelingAs a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his workSo am I made to possess months of vanity and wearisome nights are appointed to meWhen I lie down I say When shall I arise and the night be gone and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the dayMy flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become loathsomeMy days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hopeO remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see goodThe eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes are upon me and I am notAs the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no moreHe shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any moreTherefore I will not refrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soulAm I a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over meWhen I say My bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaintThen thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visionsSo that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my lifeI loathe it I would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanityWhat is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon himAnd that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every momentHow long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittleI have sinned what shall I do unto thee O thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that I am a burden to myselfAnd why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away mine iniquity for now shall I sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but I shall not beThen answered Bildad the Shuhite and saidHow long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong windDoth God pervert judgment or doth the Almighty pervert justiceIf thy children have sinned against him and he have cast them away for their transgressionIf thou wouldest seek unto God betimes and make thy supplication to the AlmightyIf thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperousThough thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increaseFor inquire I pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathersFor we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadowShall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heartCan the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without waterWhilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herbSo are the paths of all that forget God and the hypocrites hope shall perishWhose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spiders webHe shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endureHe is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his gardenHis roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of stonesIf he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying I have not seen theeBehold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others growBehold God will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doersTill he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicingThey that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to noughtThen Job answered and saidI know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with GodIf he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousandHe is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and hath prosperedWhich removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his angerWhich shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof trembleWhich commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the starsWhich alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the seaWhich maketh Arcturus Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of the southWhich doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without numberLo he goeth by me and I see him not he passeth on also but I perceive him notBehold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him What doest thouIf God will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under himHow much less shall I answer him and choose out my words to reason with himWhom though I were righteous yet would I not answer but I would make supplication to my judgeIf I had called and he had answered me yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voiceFor he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without causeHe will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitternessIf I speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to pleadIf I justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if I say I am perfect it shall also prove me perverseThough I were perfect yet would I not know my soul I would despise my lifeThis is one thing therefore I said it He destroyeth the perfect and the wickedIf the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocentThe earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is heNow my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no goodThey are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that hasteth to the preyIf I say I will forget my complaint I will leave off my heaviness and comfort myselfI am afraid of all my sorrows I know that thou wilt not hold me innocentIf I be wicked why then labour I in vainIf I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so cleanYet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor meFor he is not a man as I am that I should answer him and we should come together in judgmentNeither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us bothLet him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify meThen would I speak and not fear him but it is not so with meMy soul is weary of my life I will leave my complaint upon myself I will speak in the bitterness of my soulI will say unto God Do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with meIs it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wickedHast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seethAre thy days as the days of man are thy years as mans daysThat thou inquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sinThou knowest that I am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine handThine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy meRemember I beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust againHast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheeseThou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinewsThou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserved my spiritAnd these things hast thou hid in thine heart I know that this is with theeIf I sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquityIf I be wicked woe unto me and if I be righteous yet will I not lift up my head I am full of confusion therefore see thou mine afflictionFor it increaseth Thou huntest me as a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon meThou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and war are against meWherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb Oh that I had given up the ghost and no eye had seen meI should have been as though I had not been I should have been carried from the womb to the graveAre not my days few cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a littleBefore I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of deathA land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darknessThen answered Zophar the Naamathite and saidShould not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justifiedShould thy lies make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamedFor thou hast said My doctrine is pure and I am clean in thine eyesBut oh that God would speak and open his lips against theeAnd that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deservethCanst thou by searching find out God canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfectionIt is as high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou knowThe measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the seaIf he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder himFor he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider itFor vain man would be wise though man be born like a wild asss coltIf thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward himIf iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernaclesFor then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fearBecause thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass awayAnd thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morningAnd thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safetyAlso thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto theeBut the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghostAnd Job answered and saidNo doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with youBut I have understanding as well as you I am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as theseI am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon God and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scornHe that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at easeThe tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke God are secure into whose hand God bringeth abundantlyBut ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air and they shall tell theeOr speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto theeWho knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought thisIn whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankindDoth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meatWith the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understandingWith him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understandingBehold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no openingBehold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earthWith him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are hisHe leadeth counsellers away spoiled and maketh the judges foolsHe looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a girdleHe leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mightyHe removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the agedHe poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of the mightyHe discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of deathHe increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them againHe taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no wayThey grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken manLo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and understood itWhat ye know the same do I know also I am not inferior unto youSurely I would speak to the Almighty and I desire to reason with GodBut ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no valueO that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdomHear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lipsWill ye speak wickedly for God and talk deceitfully for himWill ye accept his person will ye contend for GodIs it good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do ye so mock himHe will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept personsShall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon youYour remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to bodies of clayHold your peace let me alone that I may speak and let come on me what willWherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine handThough he slay me yet will I trust in him but I will maintain mine own ways before himHe also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before himHear diligently my speech and my declaration with your earsBehold now I have ordered my cause I know that I shall be justifiedWho is he that will plead with me for now if I hold my tongue I shall give up the ghostOnly do not two things unto me then will I not hide myself from theeWithdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me afraidThen call thou and I will answer or let me speak and answer thou meHow many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my transgression and my sinWherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemyWilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue the dry stubbleFor thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youthThou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feetAnd he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth eatenMan that is born of a woman is of few days and full of troubleHe cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth notAnd dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with theeWho can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not oneSeeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot passTurn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling his dayFor there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not ceaseThough the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the groundYet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plantBut man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost and where is heAs the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth upSo man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleepO that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember meIf a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change comeThou shalt call and I will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine handsFor now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my sinMy transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up mine iniquityAnd surely the mountain falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of his placeThe waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of manThou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him awayHis sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of themBut his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mournThen answered Eliphaz the Temanite and saidShould a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east windShould he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he can do no goodYea thou castest off fear and restrainest prayer before GodFor thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the tongue of the craftyThine own mouth condemneth thee and not I yea thine own lips testify against theeArt thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before the hillsHast thou heard the secret of God and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyselfWhat knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which is not in usWith us are both the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy fatherAre the consolations of God small with thee is there any secret thing with theeWhy doth thine heart carry thee away and what do thy eyes wink atThat thou turnest thy spirit against God and lettest such words go out of thy mouthWhat is man that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteousBehold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the heavens are not clean in his sightHow much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like waterI will shew thee hear me and that which I have seen I will declareWhich wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid itUnto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among themThe wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressorA dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon himHe believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the swordHe wandereth abroad for bread saying Where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his handTrouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battleFor he stretcheth out his hand against God and strengtheneth himself against the AlmightyHe runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of his bucklersBecause he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanksAnd he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth which are ready to become heapsHe shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earthHe shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go awayLet not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompenceIt shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be greenHe shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the oliveFor the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of briberyThey conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceitThen Job answered and saidI have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye allShall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerestI also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my souls stead I could heap up words against you and shake mine head at youBut I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should asswage your griefThough I speak my grief is not asswaged and though I forbear what am I easedBut now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my companyAnd thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my faceHe teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon meThey have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against meGod hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wickedI was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his markHis archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the groundHe breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giantI have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dustMy face is foul with weeping and my eyelids is the shadow of deathNot for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is pureO earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no placeAlso now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on highMy friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto GodO that one might plead for a man with God as a man pleadeth for his neighbourWhen a few years are come then I shall go the way whence I shall not returnMy breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for meAre there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocationLay down now put me in a surety with thee who is he that will strike hands with meFor thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt themHe that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his children shall failHe hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime I was as a tabretMine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadowUpright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocriteThe righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and strongerBut as for you all do ye return and come now for I cannot find one wise man among youMy days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heartThey change the night into day the light is short because of darknessIf I wait the grave is mine house I have made my bed in the darknessI have said to corruption Thou art my father to the worm Thou are my mother and my sisterAnd where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see itThey shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest together is in the dustThen answered Bildad the Shuhite and saidHow long will it be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speakWherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your sightHe teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his placeYea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shineThe light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with himThe steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him downFor he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a snareThe gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against himThe snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the wayTerrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feetHis strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his sideIt shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strengthHis confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrorsIt shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitationHis roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut offHis remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the streetHe shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the worldHe shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellingsThey that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they that went before were affrightedSurely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the place of him that knoweth not GodThen Job answered and saidHow long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with wordsThese ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to meAnd be it indeed that I have erred mine error remaineth with myselfIf indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproachKnow now that God hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his netBehold I cry out of wrong but I am not heard I cry aloud but there is no judgmentHe hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my pathsHe hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my headHe hath destroyed me on every side and I am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a treeHe hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemiesHis troops come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacleHe hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from meMy kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten meThey that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger I am an alien in their sightI called my servant and he gave me no answer I intreated him with my mouthMy breath is strange to my wife though I intreated for the childrens sake of mine own bodyYea young children despised me I arose and they spake against meAll my inward friends abhorred me and they whom I loved are turned against meMy bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and I am escaped with the skin of my teethHave pity upon me have pity upon me O ye my friends for the hand of God hath touched meWhy do ye persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my fleshOh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a bookThat they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for everFor I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earthAnd though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see GodWhom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within meBut ye should say Why persecute we him seeing the root of the matter is found in meBe ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgmentThen answered Zophar the Naamathite and saidTherefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this I make hasteI have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answerKnowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earthThat the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a momentThough his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the cloudsYet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say Where is heHe shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the nightThe eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold himHis children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goodsHis bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dustThough wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongueThough he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouthYet his meat in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within himHe hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again God shall cast them out of his bellyHe shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay himHe shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butterThat which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice thereinBecause he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded notSurely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desiredThere shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his goodsIn the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon himWhen he is about to fill his belly God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eatingHe shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him throughIt is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon himAll darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacleThe heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against himThe increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrathThis is the portion of a wicked man from God and the heritage appointed unto him by GodBut Job answered and saidHear diligently my speech and let this be your consolationsSuffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken mock onAs for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubledMark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouthEven when I remember I am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my fleshWherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in powerTheir seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring before their eyesTheir houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of God upon themTheir bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calfThey send forth their little ones like a flock and their children danceThey take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organThey spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the graveTherefore they say unto God Depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy waysWhat is the Almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto himLo their good is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from meHow oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them God distributeth sorrows in his angerThey are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth awayGod layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know itHis eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the AlmightyFor what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midstShall any teach God knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are highOne dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quietHis breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrowAnd another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasureThey shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover themBehold I know your thoughts and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against meFor ye say Where is the house of the prince and where are the dwelling places of the wickedHave ye not asked them that go by the way and do ye not know their tokensThat the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrathWho shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath doneYet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tombThe clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerable before himHow then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehoodThen Eliphaz the Temanite answered and saidCan a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himselfIs it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfectWill he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgmentIs not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infiniteFor thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothingThou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungryBut as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable man dwelt in itThou has sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been brokenTherefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth theeOr darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover theeIs not God in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they areAnd thou sayest How doth God know can he judge through the dark cloudThick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heavenHast thou marked the old way which wicked men have troddenWhich were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown with a floodWhich said unto God Depart from us and what can the Almighty do for themYet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from meThe righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scornWhereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumethAcquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto theeReceive I pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heartIf thou return to the Almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernaclesThen shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooksYea the Almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silverFor then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto GodThou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vowsThou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy waysWhen men are cast down then thou shalt say There is lifting up and he shall save the humble personHe shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered by the pureness of thine handsThen Job answered and saidEven to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaningOh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seatI would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with argumentsI would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto meWill he plead against me with his great power No but he would put strength in meThere the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered for ever from my judgeBehold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive himOn the left hand where he doth work but I cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see himBut he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as goldMy foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declinedNeither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary foodBut he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doethFor he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with himTherefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider I am afraid of himFor God maketh my heart soft and the Almighty troubleth meBecause I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my faceWhy seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty do they that know him not see his daysSome remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereofThey drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows ox for a pledgeThey turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves togetherBehold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their childrenThey reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wickedThey cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no covering in the coldThey are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelterThey pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poorThey cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungryWhich make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirstMen groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet God layeth not folly to themThey are of those that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereofThe murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night is as a thiefThe eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying No eye shall see me and disguiseth his faceIn the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the lightFor the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of deathHe is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyardsDrought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave those which have sinnedThe womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a treeHe evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widowHe draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no man is sure of lifeThough it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet his eyes are upon their waysThey are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the tops of the ears of cornAnd if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my speech nothing worthThen answered Bildad the Shuhite and saidDominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high placesIs there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light ariseHow then can man be justified with God or how can he be clean that is born of a womanBehold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sightHow much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a wormBut Job answered and saidHow hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strengthHow hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it isTo whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came from theeDead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereofHell is naked before him and destruction hath no coveringHe stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothingHe bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under themHe holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon itHe hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an endThe pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproofHe divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proudBy his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpentLo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understandMoreover Job continued his parable and saidAs God liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the Almighty who hath vexed my soulAll the while my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrilsMy lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceitGod forbid that I should justify you till I die I will not remove mine integrity from meMy righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as I liveLet mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteousFor what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when God taketh away his soulWill God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon himWill he delight himself in the Almighty will he always call upon GodI will teach you by the hand of God that which is with the Almighty will I not concealBehold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus altogether vainThis is the portion of a wicked man with God and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the AlmightyIf his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with breadThose that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall not weepThough he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clayHe may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silverHe buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper makethThe rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is notTerrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away in the nightThe east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a storm hurleth him out of his placeFor God shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his handMen shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his placeSurely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine itIron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stoneHe setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of deathThe flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from menAs for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fireThe stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of goldThere is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures eye hath not seenThe lions whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by itHe putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountains by the rootsHe cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thingHe bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to lightBut where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understandingMan knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the livingThe depth saith It is not in me and the sea saith It is not with meIt cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereofIt cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphireThe gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine goldNo mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubiesThe topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure goldWhence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understandingSeeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the airDestruction and death say We have heard the fame thereof with our earsGod understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereofFor he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heavenTo make the weight for the winds and he weigheth the waters by measureWhen he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunderThen did he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and searched it outAnd unto man he said Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understandingMoreover Job continued his parable and saidOh that I were as in months past as in the days when God preserved meWhen his candle shined upon my head and when by his light I walked through darknessAs I was in the days of my youth when the secret of God was upon my tabernacleWhen the Almighty was yet with me when my children were about meWhen I washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oilWhen I went out to the gate through the city when I prepared my seat in the streetThe young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and stood upThe princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their mouthThe nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouthWhen the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to meBecause I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help himThe blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and I caused the widows heart to sing for joyI put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diademI was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lameI was a father to the poor and the cause which I knew not I searched outAnd I brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teethThen I said I shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the sandMy root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branchMy glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my handUnto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counselAfter my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon themAnd they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rainIf I laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my countenance they cast not downI chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mournersBut now they that are younger than I have me in derision whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flockYea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perishedFor want and famine they were solitary fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and wasteWho cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meatThey were driven forth from among men they cried after them as after a thiefTo dwell in the clifts of the valleys in caves of the earth and in the rocksAmong the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered togetherThey were children of fools yea children of base men they were viler than the earthAnd now am I their song yea I am their bywordThey abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my faceBecause he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also let loose the bridle before meUpon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destructionThey mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helperThey came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the desolation they rolled themselves upon meTerrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passeth away as a cloudAnd now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction have taken hold upon meMy bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no restBy the great force of my disease is my garment changed it bindeth me about as the collar of my coatHe hath cast me into the mire and I am become like dust and ashesI cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me I stand up and thou regardest me notThou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against meThou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substanceFor I know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all livingHowbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destructionDid not I weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poorWhen I looked for good then evil came unto me and when I waited for light there came darknessMy bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction prevented meI went mourning without the sun I stood up and I cried in the congregationI am a brother to dragons and a companion to owlsMy skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heatMy harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weepI made a covenant with mine eyes why then should I think upon a maidFor what portion of God is there from above and what inheritance of the Almighty from on highIs not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquityDoth not he see my ways and count all my stepsIf I have walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceitLet me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrityIf my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine handsThen let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted outIf mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if I have laid wait at my neighbours doorThen let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon herFor this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judgesFor it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increaseIf I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with meWhat then shall I do when God riseth up and when he visiteth what shall I answer himDid not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the wombIf I have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to failOr have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereofFor from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father and I have guided her from my mothers wombIf I have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without coveringIf his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheepIf I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless when I saw my help in the gateThen let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the boneFor destruction from God was a terror to me and by reason of his highness I could not endureIf I have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold Thou art my confidenceIf I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because mine hand had gotten muchIf I beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightnessAnd my heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my handThis also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for I should have denied the God that is aboveIf I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found himNeither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soulIf the men of my tabernacle said not Oh that we had of his flesh we cannot be satisfiedThe stranger did not lodge in the street but I opened my doors to the travellerIf I covered my transgressions as Adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosomDid I fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that I kept silence and went not out of the doorOh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the Almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a bookSurely I would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to meI would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would I go near unto himIf my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complainIf I have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their lifeLet thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley The words of Job are endedSo these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyesThen was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram against Job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than GodAlso against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned JobNow Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they were elder than heWhen Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindledAnd Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said I am young and ye are very old wherefore I was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinionI said Days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdomBut there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understandingGreat men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgmentTherefore I said Hearken to me I also will shew mine opinionBehold I waited for your words I gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to sayYea I attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced Job or that answered his wordsLest ye should say We have found out wisdom God thrusteth him down not manNow he hath not directed his words against me neither will I answer him with your speechesThey were amazed they answered no more they left off speakingWhen I had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no moreI said I will answer also my part I also will shew mine opinionFor I am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth meBehold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottlesI will speak that I may be refreshed I will open my lips and answerLet me not I pray you accept any mans person neither let me give flattering titles unto manFor I know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me awayWherefore Job I pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my wordsBehold now I have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouthMy words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearlyThe Spirit of God hath made me and the breath of the Almighty hath given me lifeIf thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand upBehold I am according to thy wish in Gods stead I also am formed out of the clayBehold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon theeSurely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and I have heard the voice of thy words sayingI am clean without transgression I am innocent neither is there iniquity in meBehold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his enemyHe putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my pathsBehold in this thou art not just I will answer thee that God is greater than manWhy dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his mattersFor God speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it notIn a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bedThen he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instructionThat he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from manHe keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the swordHe is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong painSo that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meatHis flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick outYea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyersIf there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightnessThen he is gracious unto him and saith Deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransomHis flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to the days of his youthHe shall pray unto God and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousnessHe looketh upon men and if any say I have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me notHe will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the lightLo all these things worketh God oftentimes with manTo bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the livingMark well O Job hearken unto me hold thy peace and I will speakIf thou hast any thing to say answer me speak for I desire to justify theeIf not hearken unto me hold thy peace and I shall teach thee wisdomFurthermore Elihu answered and saidHear my words O ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledgeFor the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meatLet us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is goodFor Job hath said I am righteous and God hath taken away my judgmentShould I lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgressionWhat man is like Job who drinketh up scorning like waterWhich goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked menFor he hath said It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with GodTherefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from God that he should do wickedness and from the Almighty that he should commit iniquityFor the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his waysYea surely God will not do wickedly neither will the Almighty pervert judgmentWho hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole worldIf he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breathAll flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dustIf now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my wordsShall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most justIs it fit to say to a king Thou art wicked and to princes Ye are ungodlyHow much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his handsIn a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without handFor his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goingsThere is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselvesFor he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with GodHe shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their steadTherefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyedHe striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of othersBecause they turned back from him and would not consider any of his waysSo that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflictedWhen he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man onlyThat the hypocrite reign not lest the people be ensnaredSurely it is meet to be said unto God I have borne chastisement I will not offend any moreThat which I see not teach thou me if I have done iniquity I will do no moreShould it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not I therefore speak what thou knowestLet men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto meJob hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without wisdomMy desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked menFor he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against GodElihu spake moreover and saidThinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst My righteousness is more than GodsFor thou saidst What advantage will it be unto thee and What profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sinI will answer thee and thy companions with theeLook unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thouIf thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto himIf thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine handThy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of manBy reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mightyBut none saith Where is God my maker who giveth songs in the nightWho teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heavenThere they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil menSurely God will not hear vanity neither will the Almighty regard itAlthough thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou in himBut now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremityTherefore doth Job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledgeElihu also proceeded and saidSuffer me a little and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on Gods behalfI will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my MakerFor truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in knowledge is with theeBehold God is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdomHe preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poorHe withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exaltedAnd if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of afflictionThen he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceededHe openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquityIf they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasuresBut if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledgeBut the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth themThey die in youth and their life is among the uncleanHe delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears in oppressionEven so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatnessBut thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on theeBecause there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver theeWill he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of strengthDesire not the night when people are cut off in their placeTake heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than afflictionBehold God exalteth by his power who teacheth like himWho hath enjoined him his way or who can say Thou hast wrought iniquityRemember that thou magnify his work which men beholdEvery man may see it man may behold it afar offBehold God is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched outFor he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain according to the vapour thereofWhich the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantlyAlso can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacleBehold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the seaFor by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundanceWith clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixtThe noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also concerning the vapourAt this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his placeHear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouthHe directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earthAfter it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heardGod thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehendFor he saith to the snow Be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strengthHe sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his workThen the beasts go into dens and remain in their placesOut of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the northBy the breath of God frost is given and the breadth of the waters is straitenedAlso by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloudAnd it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earthHe causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercyHearken unto this O Job stand still and consider the wondrous works of GodDost thou know when God disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shineDost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledgeHow thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the south windHast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong and as a molten looking glassTeach us what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darknessShall it be told him that I speak if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed upAnd now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but the wind passeth and cleanseth themFair weather cometh out of the north with God is terrible majestyTouching the Almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflictMen do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heartThen the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and saidWho is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledgeGird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou meWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understandingWho hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon itWhereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereofWhen the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joyOr who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the wombWhen I made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for itAnd brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doorsAnd said Hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayedHast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his placeThat it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of itIt is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garmentAnd from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm shall be brokenHast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depthHave the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of deathHast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it allWhere is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness where is the place thereofThat thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereofKnowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy days is greatHast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hailWhich I have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and warBy what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earthWho hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunderTo cause it to rain on the earth where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no manTo satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forthHath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dewOut of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered itThe waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozenCanst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of OrionCanst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sonsKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earthCanst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover theeCanst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee Here we areWho hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heartWho can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heavenWhen the dust groweth into hardness and the clods cleave fast togetherWilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lionsWhen they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in waitWho provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto God they wander for lack of meatKnowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calveCanst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forthThey bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrowsTheir young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not unto themWho hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands of the wild assWhose house I have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellingsHe scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the crying of the driverThe range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thingWill the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy cribCanst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after theeWilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to himWilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barnGavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrichWhich leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dustAnd forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break themShe is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labour is in vain without fearBecause God hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understandingWhat time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his riderHast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunderCanst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terribleHe paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed menHe mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the swordThe quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shieldHe swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpetHe saith among the trumpets Ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shoutingDoth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the southDoth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on highShe dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong placeFrom thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar offHer young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is sheMoreover the LORD answered Job and saidShall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer itThen Job answered the LORD and saidBehold I am vile what shall I answer thee I will lay mine hand upon my mouthOnce have I spoken but I will not answer yea twice but I will proceed no furtherThen answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind and saidGird up thy loins now like a man I will demand of thee and declare thou unto meWilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteousHast thou an arm like God or canst thou thunder with a voice like himDeck thyself now with majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beautyCast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase himLook on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked in their placeHide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secretThen will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save theeBehold now behemoth which I made with thee he eateth grass as an oxLo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his bellyHe moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are wrapped togetherHis bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars of ironHe is the chief of the ways of God he that made him can make his sword to approach unto himSurely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field playHe lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fensThe shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the brook compass him aboutBehold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouthHe taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snaresCanst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest downCanst thou put an hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thornWill he make many supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto theeWill he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant for everWilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidensShall the companions make a banquet of him shall they part him among the merchantsCanst thou fill his skin with barbed iron or his head with fish spearsLay thine hand upon him remember the battle do no moreBehold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of himNone is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before meWho hath prevented me that I should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mineI will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely proportionWho can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him with his double bridleWho can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round aboutHis scales are his pride shut up together as with a close sealOne is so near to another that no air can come between themThey are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sunderedBy his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morningOut of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap outOut of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or caldronHis breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouthIn his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before himThe flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in themselves they cannot be movedHis heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstoneWhen he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purify themselvesThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeonHe esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten woodThe arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubbleDarts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spearSharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mireHe maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointmentHe maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoaryUpon earth there is not his like who is made without fearHe beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children of prideThen Job answered the LORD and saidI know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from theeWho is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew notHear I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto meI have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth theeWherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashesAnd it was so that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite My wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant Job hathTherefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant Job shall pray for you for him will I accept lest I deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant JobSo Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as the LORD commanded them the LORD also accepted JobAnd the LORD turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had beforeThen came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of goldSo the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she assesHe had also seven sons and three daughtersAnd he called the name of the first Jemima and the name of the second Kezia and the name of the third Keren-happuchAnd in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethrenAfter this lived Job an hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generationsSo Job died being old and full of daysBlessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornfulBut his delight is in the law of the LORD and in his law doth he meditate day and nightAnd he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosperThe ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth awayTherefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteousFor the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perishWhy do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thingThe kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD and against his anointed sayingLet us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from usHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the Lord shall have them in derisionThen shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasureYet have I set my king upon my holy hill of ZionI will declare the decree the LORD hath said unto me Thou art my Son this day have I begotten theeAsk of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possessionThou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vesselBe wise now therefore O ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earthServe the LORD with fear and rejoice with tremblingKiss the Son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little Blessed are all they that put their trust in himLORD how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against meMany there be which say of my soul There is no help for him in God SelahBut thou O LORD art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine headI cried unto the LORD with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill SelahI laid me down and slept I awaked for the LORD sustained meI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round aboutArise O LORD save me O my God for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodlySalvation belongeth unto the LORD thy blessing is upon thy people SelahHear me when I call O God of my righteousness thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayerO ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing SelahBut know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself the LORD will hear when I call unto himStand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still SelahOffer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the LORDThere be many that say Who will shew us any good LORD lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon usThou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increasedI will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou LORD only makest me dwell in safetyGive ear to my words O LORD consider my meditationHearken unto the voice of my cry my King and my God for unto thee will I prayMy voice shalt thou hear in the morning O LORD in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look upFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness neither shall evil dwell with theeThe foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquityThou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful manBut as for me I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy templeLead me O LORD in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my faceFor there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongueDestroy thou them O God let them fall by their own counsels cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against theeBut let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful in theeFor thou LORD wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shieldO LORD rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasureHave mercy upon me O LORD for I am weak O LORD heal me for my bones are vexedMy soul is also sore vexed but thou O LORD how longReturn O LORD deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sakeFor in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanksI am weary with my groaning all the night make I my bed to swim I water my couch with my tearsMine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine enemiesDepart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weepingThe LORD hath heard my supplication the LORD will receive my prayerLet all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenlyO Lord my God in thee do I put my trust save me from all them that persecute me and deliver meLest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliverO LORD my God if I have done this if there be iniquity in my handsIf I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemyLet the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust SelahArise O LORD in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commandedSo shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for their sakes therefore return thou on highThe LORD shall judge the people judge me O LORD according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in meOh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the just for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reinsMy defence is of God which saveth the upright in heartGod judgeth the righteous and God is angry with the wicked every dayIf he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it readyHe hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutorsBehold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehoodHe made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which he madeHis mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pateI will praise the LORD according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most highO LORD our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who hast set thy glory above the heavensOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avengerWhen I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordainedWhat is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest himFor thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honourThou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feetAll sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the fieldThe fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seasO LORD our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the earthI will praise thee O LORD with my whole heart I will shew forth all thy marvellous worksI will be glad and rejoice in thee I will sing praise to thy name O thou most HighWhen mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presenceFor thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou satest in the throne judging rightThou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked thou hast put out their name for ever and everO thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with themBut the LORD shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne for judgmentAnd he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightnessThe LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of troubleAnd they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou LORD hast not forsaken them that seek theeSing praises to the LORD which dwelleth in Zion declare among the people his doingsWhen he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he forgetteth not the cry of the humbleHave mercy upon me O LORD consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of deathThat I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvationThe heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot takenThe LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands Higgaion SelahThe wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget GodFor the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish for everArise O LORD let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in thy sightPut them in fear O LORD that the nations may know themselves to be but men SelahWhy standest thou afar off O LORD why hidest thou thyself in times of troubleThe wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imaginedFor the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire and blesseth the covetous whom the LORD abhorrethThe wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God God is not in all his thoughtsHis ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at themHe hath said in his heart I shall not be moved for I shall never be in adversityHis mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his tongue is mischief and vanityHe sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the poorHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his netHe croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by his strong onesHe hath said in his heart God hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see itArise O LORD O God lift up thine hand forget not the humbleWherefore doth the wicked contemn God he hath said in his heart Thou wilt not require itThou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou art the helper of the fatherlessBreak thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his wickedness till thou find noneThe LORD is King for ever and ever the heathen are perished out of his landLORD thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hearTo judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no more oppressIn the LORD put I my trust How say ye to my soul Flee as a bird to your mountainFor lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heartIf the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous doThe LORD is in his holy temple the LORDs throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of menThe LORD trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hatethUpon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cupFor the righteous LORD loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the uprightHelp LORD for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of menThey speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speakThe LORD shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud thingsWho have said With our tongue will we prevail our lips are our own who is lord over usFor the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will I arise saith the LORD I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at himThe words of the LORD are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven timesThou shalt keep them O LORD thou shalt preserve them from this generation for everThe wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exaltedHow long wilt thou forget me O LORD for ever how long wilt thou hide thy face from meHow long shall I take counsel in my soul having sorrow in

goodly heritageI will bless the LORD who hath given me counsel my reins also instruct me in the night seasonsI have set the LORD always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be

lipsLet my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equalThou has proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night thou has tried me and shalt find nothing I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgressConcerning the works of men by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyerHold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip notI have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me O God incline thine ear unto me and hear my speechShew thy marvellous lovingkindness O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against themKeep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wingsFrom the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who compass me aboutThey are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudlyThey have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earthLike as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret placesArise O LORD disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy swordFrom men which are thy hand O LORD from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babesAs for me I will behold thy face in

buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high towerI will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemiesThe sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraidThe sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented meIn my distress I called upon the LORD and cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his earsThen the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wrothThere went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by itHe bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feetAnd he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the windHe made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skiesAt the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fireThe LORD also thundered in the heavens and the Highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fireYea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited themThen the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke O LORD at the blast of the breath of thy nostrilsHe sent from above he took me he drew me out of many watersHe delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for meThey prevented me in the day of my calamity but the LORD was my stayHe brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in meThe LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed meFor I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my GodFor all his judgments were before me and I did not put away his statutes from meI was also upright before him and I kept myself from mine iniquityTherefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesightWith the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself uprightWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself frowardFor thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down high looksFor thou wilt light my candle the LORD my God will enlighten my darknessFor by thee I have run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wallAs for God his way is perfect the word of the LORD is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in himFor who is God save the LORD or who is a rock save our GodIt is God that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfectHe maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high placesHe teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine armsThou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me greatThou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slipI have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did I turn again till they were consumedI have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feetFor thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against meThou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that I might destroy them that hate meThey cried but there was none to save them even unto the LORD but he answered them notThen did I beat them small as the dust before the wind I did cast them out as the dirt in the streetsThou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom I have not known shall serve meAs soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto meThe strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close placesThe LORD liveth and blessed be my rock and let the God of my salvation be exaltedIt is God that avengeth me and subdueth the people under meHe delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent manTherefore will I give thanks unto thee O LORD among the heathen and sing praises unto thy nameGreat deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed to David and to his seed for evermoreThe heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth his handyworkDay unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledgeThere is no speech nor language where their voice is not heardTheir line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sunWhich is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a raceHis going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereofThe law of the LORD is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the LORD is sure making wise the simpleThe statutes of the LORD are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyesThe fear of the LORD is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogetherMore to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycombMoreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great rewardWho can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faultsKeep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgressionLet the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O LORD my strength and my redeemerThe LORD hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the God of Jacob defend theeSend thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of ZionRemember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice SelahGrant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy counselWe will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the LORD fulfil all thy petitionsNow know I that the LORD saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right handSome trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the LORD our GodThey are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand uprightSave LORD let the king hear us when we callThe king shall joy in thy strength O LORD and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoiceThou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips SelahFor thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou settest a crown of pure gold on his headHe asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of days for ever and everHis glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou laid upon himFor thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenanceFor the king trusteth in the LORD and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be movedThine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate theeThou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour themTheir fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of menFor they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to performTherefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of themBe thou exalted LORD in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy powerMy God my God why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaringO my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silentBut thou art holy O thou that inhabitest the praises of IsraelOur fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver themThey cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confoundedBut I am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the peopleAll they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head sayingHe trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in himBut thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mothers breastsI was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my God from my mothers bellyBe not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to helpMany bulls have compassed me strong bulls of Bashan have beset me roundThey gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lionI am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowelsMy strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of deathFor dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feetI may tell all my bones they look and stare upon meThey part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vestureBut be not thou far from me O LORD O my strength haste thee to help meDeliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dogSave me from the lions mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicornsI will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise theeYe that fear the LORD praise him all ye the seed of Jacob glorify him and

generationThey shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done thisThe LORD is my shepherd I shall not wantHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures

not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large roomHave mercy upon me O LORD for I am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yea my soul and my bellyFor my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumedI was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from meI am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken vesselFor I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my lifeBut I trusted in thee O LORD I said Thou art my GodMy times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute meMake thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercies sakeLet me not be ashamed O LORD for I have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the graveLet the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteousOh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of menThou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tonguesBlessed be the LORD for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong cityFor I said in my haste I am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto theeO love the LORD all ye his saints for the LORD preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doerBe of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the LORDBlessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is coveredBlessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guileWhen I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day longFor day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer SelahI acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin SelahFor this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto himThou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance SelahI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eyeBe ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto theeMany sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the LORD mercy shall compass him aboutBe glad in the LORD and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heartRejoice in the LORD O ye righteous for praise is comely for the uprightPraise the LORD with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten stringsSing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noiseFor the word of the LORD is right and all his works are done in truthHe loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the LORDBy the word of the LORD were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouthHe gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth up the depth in storehousesLet all the earth fear the LORD let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of himFor he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fastThe LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he maketh the devices of the people of none effectThe counsel of the LORD standeth for ever the thoughts of his heart to all generationsBlessed is the nation whose God is the LORD and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritanceThe LORD looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of menFrom the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earthHe fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their worksThere is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strengthAn horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strengthBehold the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercyTo deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famineOur soul waiteth for the LORD he is our help and our shieldFor our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy nameLet thy mercy O LORD be upon us according as we hope in theeI will bless the LORD at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouthMy soul shall make her boast in the LORD the humble shall hear thereof and be gladO magnify the LORD with me and let us exalt his name togetherI sought the LORD and he heard me and delivered me from all my fearsThey looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamedThis poor man cried and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troublesThe angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth themO taste and see that the LORD is good blessed is the man that trusteth in himO fear the LORD ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear himThe young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thingCome ye children hearken unto me I will teach you the fear of the LORDWhat man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see goodKeep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guileDepart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue itThe eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cryThe face of the LORD is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earthThe righteous cry and the LORD heareth and delivereth them out of all their troublesThe LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spiritMany are the afflictions of the righteous but the LORD delivereth him out of them allHe keepeth all his bones not one of them is brokenEvil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolateThe LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolatePlead my cause O LORD with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against meTake hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine helpDraw out also the spear and stop the way against them that persecute me say unto my soul I am thy salvationLet them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurtLet them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the LORD chase themLet their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the LORD persecute themFor without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit which without cause they have digged for my soulLet destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fallAnd my soul shall be joyful in the LORD it shall rejoice in his salvationAll my bones shall say LORD who is like unto thee which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor and the needy from him that spoileth himFalse witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that I knew notThey rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soulBut as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth I humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own bosomI behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother I bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his motherBut in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me and I knew it not they did tear me and ceased notWith hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their teethLord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lionsI will give thee thanks in the great congregation I will praise thee among much peopleLet not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a causeFor they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the landYea they opened their mouth wide against me and said Aha aha our eye hath seen itThis thou hast seen O LORD keep not silence O Lord be not far from meStir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause my God and my LordJudge me O LORD my God according to thy righteousness and let them not rejoice over meLet them not say in their hearts Ah so would we have it let them not say We have swallowed him upLet them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against meLet them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous cause yea let them say continually Let the LORD be magnified which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servantAnd my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day longThe transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of God before his eyesFor he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hatefulThe words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do goodHe deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evilThy mercy O LORD is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the cloudsThy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep O LORD thou preservest man and beastHow excellent is thy lovingkindness O God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wingsThey shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasuresFor with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see lightO continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heartLet not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove meThere are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to riseFret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquityFor they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herbTrust in the LORD and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fedDelight thyself also in the LORD and he shall give thee the desires of thine heartCommit thy way unto the LORD trust also in him and he shall bring it to passAnd he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noondayRest in the LORD and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to passCease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evilFor evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the LORD they shall inherit the earthFor yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not beBut the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peaceThe wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teethThe Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is comingThe wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright conversationTheir sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be brokenA little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wickedFor the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the LORD upholdeth the righteousThe LORD knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be for everThey shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfiedBut the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume awayThe wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and givethFor such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut offThe steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD and he delighteth in his wayThough he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the LORD upholdeth him with his handI have been young and now am old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging breadHe is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessedDepart from evil and do good and dwell for evermoreFor the LORD loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut offThe righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for everThe mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgmentThe law of his God is in his heart none of his steps shall slideThe wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay himThe LORD will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judgedWait on the LORD and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see itI have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay treeYet he passed away and lo he was not yea I sought him but he could not be foundMark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peaceBut the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut offBut the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD he is their strength in the time of troubleAnd the LORD shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in himO LORD rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasureFor thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me soreThere is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sinFor mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden they are too heavy for meMy wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishnessI am troubled I am bowed down greatly I go mourning all the day longFor my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no soundness in my fleshI am feeble and sore broken I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heartLord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from theeMy heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from meMy lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my kinsmen stand afar offThey also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day longBut I as a deaf man heard not and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouthThus I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofsFor in thee O LORD do I hope thou wilt hear O Lord my GodFor I said Hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against meFor I am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before meFor I will declare mine iniquity I will be sorry for my sinBut mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multipliedThey also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because I follow the thing that good isForsake me not O LORD O my God be not far from meMake haste to help me O Lord my salvationI said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before meI was dumb with silence I held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirredMy heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire burned then spake I with my tongueLORD make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that I may know how frail I amBehold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity SelahSurely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather themAnd now Lord what wait I for my hope is in theeDeliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolishI was dumb I opened not my mouth because thou didst itRemove thy stroke away from me I am consumed by the blow of thine handWhen thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity SelahHear my prayer O LORD and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers wereO spare me that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no moreI waited patiently for the LORD and he inclined unto me and heard my cryHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goingsAnd he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the LORDBlessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to liesMany O LORD my God are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numberedSacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not requiredThen said I Lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of meI delight to do thy will O my God yea thy law is within my heartI have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo I have not refrained my lips O LORD thou knowestI have not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregationWithhold not thou thy tender mercies from me O LORD let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve meFor innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that I am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth meBe pleased O LORD to deliver me O LORD make haste to help meLet them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evilLet them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me Aha ahaLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually The LORD be magnifiedBut I am poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying O my GodBlessed is he that considereth the poor the LORD will deliver him in time of troubleThe LORD will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemiesThe LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sicknessI said LORD be merciful unto me heal my soul for I have sinned against theeMine enemies speak evil of me When shall he die and his name perishAnd if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth itAll that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurtAn evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no moreYea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against meBut thou O LORD be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite themBy this I know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over meAnd as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for everBlessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting Amen and AmenAs the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee O GodMy soul thirsteth for God for the living God when shall I come and appear before GodMy tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me Where is thy GodWhen I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holydayWhy art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenanceO my God my soul is cast down within me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermonites from the hill MizarDeep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over meYet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the God of my lifeI will say unto God my rock Why hast thou forgotten me why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemyAs with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me Where is thy GodWhy art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my GodJudge me O God and plead my cause against an ungodly nation O

cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my GodWe have heard with our ears O God our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of oldHow thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them outFor they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto themThou art my King O God command deliverances for JacobThrough thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against usFor I will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save meBut thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated usIn God we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever SelahBut thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armiesThou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselvesThou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathenThou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their priceThou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about usThou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the peopleMy confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered meFor the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avengerAll this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenantOur heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy wayThough thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of deathIf we have forgotten the name of our God or stretched out our hands to a strange godShall not God search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heartYea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughterAwake why sleepest thou O Lord arise cast us not off for everWherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppressionFor our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earthArise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sakeMy heart is inditing a good matter I speak of the things which I have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writerThou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore God hath blessed thee for everGird thy sword upon thy thigh O most mighty with thy glory and thy majestyAnd in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible thingsThine arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies whereby the people fall under theeThy throne O God is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptreThou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellowsAll thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee gladKings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of OphirHearken O daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy fathers houseSo shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy Lord and worship thou himAnd the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favourThe kings daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought goldShe shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto theeWith gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the kings palaceInstead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest make princes in all the earthI will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and everGod is our refuge and strength a very present help in troubleTherefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the seaThough the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof SelahThere is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the tabernacles of the most HighGod is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right earlyThe heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth meltedThe LORD of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge SelahCome behold the works of the LORD what desolations he hath made in the earthHe maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fireBe still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heathen I will be exalted in the earthThe LORD of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge SelahO clap your hands all ye people shout unto God with the voice of triumphFor the LORD most high is terrible he is a great King over all the earthHe shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feetHe shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of Jacob whom he loved SelahGod is gone up with a shout the LORD with the sound of a trumpetSing praises to God sing praises sing praises unto our King sing praisesFor God is the King of all the earth sing ye praises with understandingGod reigneth over the heathen God sitteth upon the throne of his holinessThe princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the God of Abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto God he is greatly exaltedGreat is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God in the mountain of his holinessBeautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion on the sides of the north the city of the great KingGod is known in her palaces for a refugeFor lo the kings were assembled they passed by togetherThey saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted awayFear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travailThou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east windAs we have heard so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts in the city of our God God will establish it for ever SelahWe have thought of thy lovingkindness O God in the midst of thy templeAccording to thy name O God so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousnessLet mount Zion rejoice let the daughters of Judah be glad because of thy judgmentsWalk about Zion and go round about her tell the towers thereofMark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation followingFor this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto deathHear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the worldBoth low and high rich and poor togetherMy mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understandingI will incline mine ear to a parable I will open my dark saying upon the harpWherefore should I fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me aboutThey that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their richesNone of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a ransom for himFor the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for everThat he should still live for ever and not see corruptionFor he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to othersTheir inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own namesNevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perishThis their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings SelahLike sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwellingBut God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me SelahBe not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increasedFor when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after himThough while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyselfHe shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see lightMan that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perishThe mighty God even the LORD hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereofOut of Zion the perfection of beauty God hath shinedOur God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about himHe shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his peopleGather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrificeAnd the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is judge himself SelahHear O my people and I will speak O Israel and I will testify against thee I am God even thy GodI will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before meI will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy foldsFor every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hillsI know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mineIf I were hungry I would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereofWill I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goatsOffer unto God thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most HighAnd call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify meBut unto the wicked God saith What hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouthSeeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind theeWhen thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterersThou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceitThou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mothers sonThese things hast thou done and I kept silence thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself but I will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyesNow consider this ye that forget God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliverWhoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of GodHave mercy upon me O God according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressionsWash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sinFor I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before meAgainst thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgestBehold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive meBehold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdomPurge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snowMake me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoiceHide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquitiesCreate in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within meCast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from meRestore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spiritThen will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto theeDeliver me from bloodguiltiness O God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousnessO Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praiseFor thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou delightest not in burnt offeringThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despiseDo good in thy good pleasure unto Zion build thou the walls of JerusalemThen shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altarWhy boastest thou thyself in mischief O mighty man the goodness of God endureth continuallyThy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp rasor working deceitfullyThou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness SelahThou lovest all devouring words O thou deceitful tongueGod shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living SelahThe righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at himLo this is the man that made not God his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickednessBut I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in the mercy of God for ever and everI will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and I will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saintsThe fool hath said in his heart There is no God Corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth goodGod looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek GodEvery one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not oneHave the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon GodThere were they in great fear where no fear was for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because God hath despised themOh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion When God bringeth back the captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be gladSave me O God by thy name and judge me by thy strengthHear my prayer O God give ear to the words of my mouthFor strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set God before them SelahBehold God is mine helper the Lord is with them that uphold my soulHe shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truthI will freely sacrifice unto thee I will praise thy name O LORD for it is goodFor he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemiesGive ear to my prayer O God and hide not thyself from my supplicationAttend unto me and hear me I mourn in my complaint and make a noiseBecause of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate meMy heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon meFearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed meAnd I said Oh that I had wings like a dove for then would I fly away and be at restLo then would I wander far off and remain in the wilderness SelahI would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempestDestroy O Lord and divide their tongues for I have seen violence and strife in the cityDay and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of itWickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streetsFor it was not an enemy that reproached me then I could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then I would have hid myself from himBut it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintanceWe took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of God in companyLet death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among themAs for me I will call upon God and the LORD shall save meEvening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voiceHe hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with meGod shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old Selah Because they have no changes therefore they fear not GodHe hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenantThe words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swordsCast thy burden upon the LORD and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be movedBut thou O God shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but I will trust in theeBe merciful unto me O God for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth meMine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me O thou most HighWhat time I am afraid I will trust in theeIn God I will praise his word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto meEvery day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evilThey gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soulShall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people O GodThou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy bookWhen I cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this I know for God is for meIn God will I praise his word in the LORD will I praise his wordIn God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do unto meThy vows are upon me O God I will render praises unto theeFor thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the livingBe merciful unto me O God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpastI will cry unto God most high unto God that performeth all things for meHe shall send from heaven and save from the reproach of him that would swallow me up Selah God shall send forth his mercy and his truthMy soul is among lions and I lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp swordBe thou exalted O God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earthThey have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves SelahMy heart is fixed O God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praiseAwake up my glory awake psaltery and harp I myself will awake earlyI will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the nationsFor thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the cloudsBe thou exalted O God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earthDo ye indeed speak righteousness O congregation do ye judge uprightly O ye sons of menYea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earthThe wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking liesTheir poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her earWhich will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wiselyBreak their teeth O God in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions O LORDLet them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in piecesAs a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sunBefore your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrathThe righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wickedSo that a man shall say Verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a God that judgeth in the earthDeliver me from mine enemies O my God defend me from them that rise up against meDeliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody menFor lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin O LORDThey run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and beholdThou therefore O LORD God of hosts the God of Israel awake to visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors SelahThey return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go round about the cityBehold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their lips for who say they doth hearBut thou O LORD shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the heathen in derisionBecause of his strength will I wait upon thee for God is my defenceThe God of my mercy shall prevent me God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemiesSlay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down O Lord our shieldFor the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speakConsume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth SelahAnd at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the cityLet them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfiedBut I will sing of thy power yea I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my troubleUnto thee O my strength will I sing for God is my defence and the God of my mercyO God thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast been displeased O turn thyself to us againThou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal the breaches thereof for it shakethThou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishmentThou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth SelahThat thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear meGod hath spoken in his holiness I will rejoice I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of SuccothGilead is mine and Manasseh is mine Ephraim also is the strength of mine head Judah is my lawgiverMoab is my washpot over Edom will I cast out my shoe Philistia triumph thou because of meWho will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into EdomWilt not thou O God which hadst cast us off and thou O God which didst not go out with our armiesGive us help from trouble for vain is the help of manThrough God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemiesHear my cry O God attend unto my prayerFrom the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than IFor thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemyI will abide in thy tabernacle for ever I will trust in the covert of thy wings SelahFor thou O God hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy nameThou wilt prolong the kings life and his years as many generationsHe shall abide before God for ever O prepare mercy and truth which may preserve himSo will I sing praise unto thy name for ever that I may daily perform my vowsTruly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvationHe only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence I shall not be greatly movedHow long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fenceThey only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly SelahMy soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from himHe only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence I shall not be movedIn God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in GodTrust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us SelahSurely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanityTrust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon themGod hath spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto GodAlso unto thee O Lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his workO God thou art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water isTo see thy power and thy glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuaryBecause thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise theeThus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy nameMy soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lipsWhen I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watchesBecause thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoiceMy soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth meBut those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earthThey shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxesBut the king shall rejoice in God every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stoppedHear my voice O God in my prayer preserve my life from fear of the enemyHide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the insurrection of the workers of iniquityWho whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter wordsThat they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they shoot at him and fear notThey encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of laying snares privily they say Who shall see themThey search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deepBut God shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be woundedSo they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all that see them shall flee awayAnd all men shall fear and shall declare the work of God for they shall wisely consider of his doingThe righteous shall be glad in the LORD and shall trust in him and all the upright in heart shall gloryPraise waiteth for thee O God in Sion and unto thee shall the vow be performedO thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh comeIniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them awayBlessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy templeBy terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us O God of our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the seaWhich by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded with powerWhich stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves and the tumult of the peopleThey also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoiceThou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God which is

where the floods overflow meI am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while I wait for my GodThey that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then I restored that which I took not awayO God thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from theeLet not them that wait on thee O Lord GOD of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake O God of IsraelBecause for thy sake I have borne reproach shame hath covered my faceI am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mothers childrenFor the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon meWhen I wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproachI made sackcloth also my garment and I became a proverb to themThey that sit in the gate speak against me and I was the song of the drunkardsBut as for me my prayer is unto thee O LORD in an acceptable time O God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvationDeliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep watersLet not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon meHear me O LORD for thy lovingkindness is good turn

enemiesThou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before theeReproach hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness and I looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but I found noneThey gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drinkLet their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trapLet their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shakePour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of themLet their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tentsFor they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast woundedAdd iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousnessLet them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteousBut I am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation O God set me up on highI will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify him with thanksgivingThis also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofsThe humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek GodFor the LORD heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisonersLet the heaven and earth praise him the seas and everything that moveth thereinFor God will save Zion and will build the cities of Judah that they may dwell there and have it in possessionThe seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell thereinMake haste O God to deliver me make haste to help me O LORDLet them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurtLet them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say Aha ahaLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually Let God be magnifiedBut I am poor and needy make haste unto me O God thou art my help and my deliverer O LORD make no tarryingIn thee O LORD do I put my trust let me never be put to confusionDeliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save meBe thou my strong habitation whereunto I may continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortressDeliver me O my God out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel manFor thou art my hope O Lord GOD thou art my trust from my youthBy thee have I been holden up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mothers bowels my praise shall be continually of theeI am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refugeLet my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the dayCast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength failethFor mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel togetherSaying God hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver himO God be not far from me O my God make haste for my helpLet them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurtBut I will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and moreMy mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the numbers thereofI will go in the strength of the Lord GOD I will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine onlyO God thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous worksNow also when I am old and grayheaded O God forsake me not until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to comeThy righteousness also O God is very high who hast done great things O God who is like unto theeThou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earthThou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every sideI will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth O my God unto thee will I sing with the harp O thou Holy One of IsraelMy lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemedMy tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurtGive the king thy judgments O God and thy righteousness unto the kings sonHe shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgmentThe mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousnessHe shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressorThey shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generationsHe shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earthIn his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace so long as the moon endurethHe shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earthThey that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dustThe kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer giftsYea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve himFor he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helperHe shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needyHe shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sightAnd he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praisedThere shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earthHis name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessedBlessed be the LORD God the God of Israel who only doeth wondrous thingsAnd blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory Amen and AmenThe prayers of David the son of Jesse are endedTruly God is good to Israel even to such as are of a clean heartBut as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slippedFor I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wickedFor there are no bands in their death but their strength is firmThey are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other menTherefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garmentTheir eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wishThey are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftilyThey set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earthTherefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to themAnd they say How doth God know and is there knowledge in the most HighBehold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in richesVerily I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocencyFor all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morningIf I say I will speak thus behold I should offend against the generation of thy childrenWhen I thought to know this it was too painful for meUntil I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I their endSurely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destructionHow are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrorsAs a dream when one awaketh so O Lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their imageThus my heart was grieved and I was pricked in my reinsSo foolish was I and ignorant I was as a beast before theeNevertheless I am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right handThou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to gloryWhom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that I desire beside theeMy flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for everFor lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from theeBut it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust in the Lord GOD that I may declare all thy worksO God why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pastureRemember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount Zion wherein thou hast dweltLift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuaryThine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signsA man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick treesBut now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammersThey have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the groundThey said in their hearts Let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the landWe see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how longO God how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for everWhy withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosomFor God is my King of old working salvation in the midst of the earthThou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the watersThou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wildernessThou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty riversThe day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sunThou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winterRemember this that the enemy hath reproached O LORD and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy nameO deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for everHave respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of crueltyO let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy nameArise O God plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee dailyForget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continuallyUnto thee O God do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declareWhen I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightlyThe earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved I bear up the pillars of it SelahI said unto the fools Deal not foolishly and to the wicked Lift not up the hornLift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neckFor promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the southBut God is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up anotherFor in the hand of the LORD there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink themBut I will declare for ever I will sing praises to the God of JacobAll the horns of the wicked also will I cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exaltedIn Judah is God known his name is great in IsraelIn Salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in ZionThere brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle SelahThou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of preyThe stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their handsAt thy rebuke O God of Jacob both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleepThou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angryThou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was stillWhen God arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth SelahSurely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrainVow and pay unto the LORD your God let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be fearedHe shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earthI cried unto God with my voice even unto God with my voice and he gave ear unto meIn the day of my trouble I sought the Lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comfortedI remembered God and was troubled I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed SelahThou holdest mine eyes waking I am so troubled that I cannot speakI have considered the days of old the years of ancient timesI call to remembrance my song in the night I commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent searchWill the Lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no moreIs his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermoreHath God forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies SelahAnd I said This is my infirmity but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most HighI will remember the works of the LORD surely I will remember thy wonders of oldI will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doingsThy way O God is in the sanctuary who is so great a God as our GodThou art the God that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the peopleThou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of Jacob and Joseph SelahThe waters saw thee O God the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubledThe clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroadThe voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shookThy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not knownThou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and AaronGive ear O my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouthI will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of oldWhich we have heard and known and our fathers have told usWe will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath doneFor he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their childrenThat the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their childrenThat they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandmentsAnd might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with GodThe children of Ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battleThey kept not the covenant of God and refused to walk in his lawAnd forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed themMarvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of ZoanHe divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heapIn the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fireHe clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depthsHe brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like riversAnd they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wildernessAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lustYea they spake against God they said Can God furnish a table in the wildernessBehold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his peopleTherefore the LORD heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also came up against IsraelBecause they believed not in God and trusted not in his salvationThough he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heavenAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them of the corn of heavenMan did eat angels food he sent them meat to the fullHe caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south windHe rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the seaAnd he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitationsSo they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desireThey were not estranged from their lust But while their meat was yet in their mouthsThe wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of IsraelFor all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous worksTherefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in troubleWhen he slew them then they sought him and they returned and inquired early after GodAnd they remembered that God was their rock and the high God their redeemerNevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tonguesFor their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenantBut he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrathFor he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not againHow oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desertYea they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of IsraelThey remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemyHow he had wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of ZoanAnd had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drinkHe sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed themHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locustHe destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frostHe gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderboltsHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among themHe made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilenceAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of HamBut made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flockAnd he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemiesAnd he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchasedHe cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tentsYet they tempted and provoked the most high God and kept not his testimoniesBut turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bowFor they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven imagesWhen God heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred IsraelSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh the tent which he placed among menAnd delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemys handHe gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritanceThe fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriageTheir priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentationThen the Lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wineAnd he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproachMoreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph and chose not the tribe of EphraimBut chose the tribe of Judah the mount Zion which he lovedAnd he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for everHe chose David also his servant and took him from the sheepfoldsFrom following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritanceSo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his handsO God the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid Jerusalem on heapsThe dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earthTheir blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury themWe are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about usHow long LORD wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like firePour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy nameFor they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling placeO remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very lowHelp us O God of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy names sakeWherefore should the heathen say Where is their God let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shedLet the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to dieAnd render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee O LordSo we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generationsGive ear O Shepherd of Israel thou that leadest Joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forthBefore Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save usTurn us again O God and cause thy face to shine and we shall be savedO LORD God of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy peopleThou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measureThou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselvesTurn us again O God of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be savedThou hast brought a vine out of Egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted itThou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the landThe hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedarsShe sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the riverWhy hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck herThe boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour itReturn we beseech thee O God of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vineAnd the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyselfIt is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenanceLet thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyselfSo will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy nameTurn us again O LORD God of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be savedSing aloud unto God our strength make a joyful noise unto the God of JacobTake a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psalteryBlow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast dayFor this was a statute for Israel and a law of the God of JacobThis he ordained in Joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt where I heard a language that I understood notI removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the potsThou calledst in trouble and I delivered thee I answered thee in the secret place of thunder I proved thee at the waters of Meribah SelahHear O my people and I will testify unto thee O Israel if thou wilt hearken unto meThere shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange godI am the LORD thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill itBut my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of meSo I gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counselsOh that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked in my waysI should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversariesThe haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for everHe should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied theeGod standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the godsHow long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked SelahDefend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needyDeliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wickedThey know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of courseI have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most HighBut ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princesArise O God judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nationsKeep not thou silence O God hold not thy peace and be not still O GodFor lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the headThey have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden onesThey have said Come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of Israel may be no more in remembranceFor they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against theeThe tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites of Moab and the HagarenesGebal and Ammon and Amalek the Philistines with the inhabitants of TyreAssur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of Lot SelahDo unto them as unto the Midianites as to Sisera as to Jabin at the brook of KisonWhich perished at Endor they became as dung for the earthMake their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb yea all their princes as Zebah and as ZalmunnaWho said Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possessionO my God make them like a wheel as the stubble before the windAs the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fireSo persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy stormFill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name O LORDLet them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perishThat men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH art the most high over all the earthHow amiable are thy tabernacles O LORD of hostsMy soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the LORD my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living GodYea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars O LORD of hosts my King and my GodBlessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee SelahBlessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of themWho passing through the valley of Baca make it a well the rain also filleth the poolsThey go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appeareth before GodO LORD God of hosts hear my prayer give ear O God of Jacob SelahBehold O God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointedFor a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickednessFor the LORD God is a sun and shield the LORD will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightlyO LORD of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in theeLORD thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of JacobThou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin SelahThou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine angerTurn us O God of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to ceaseWilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generationsWilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in theeShew us thy mercy O LORD and grant us thy salvationI will hear what God the LORD will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to follySurely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our landMercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each otherTruth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heavenYea the LORD shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increaseRighteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his stepsBow down thine ear O LORD hear me for I am poor and needyPreserve my soul for I

troubledThou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenanceFor all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is toldThe days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly awayWho knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrathSo teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdomReturn O LORD how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servantsO satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our daysMake us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evilLet thy work appear unto thy

and let my cry come unto theeHide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedilyFor my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an hearthMy heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my breadBy reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skinI am like a pelican of the wilderness I am like an owl of the desertI watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house topMine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against meFor I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weepingBecause of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me downMy days are like a shadow that declineth and I am withered like grassBut thou O LORD shalt endure for ever and thy remembrance unto all generationsThou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favour her yea the set time is comeFor thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereofSo the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD and all the kings of the earth thy gloryWhen the LORD shall build up Zion he shall appear in his gloryHe will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayerThis shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORDFor he hath

Zion and his praise in JerusalemWhen the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the LORDHe weakened my strength in the way he shortened my daysI said O my God take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generationsOf old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy handsThey shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changedBut thou art the same and thy years shall have no endThe children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before theeBless the LORD O my soul and all that is within me bless his holy nameBless the LORD O my soul and forget not all his benefitsWho forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseasesWho redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender merciesWho satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eaglesThe LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressedHe made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of IsraelThe LORD is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercyHe will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for everHe hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquitiesFor as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear himAs far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from usLike as a father pitieth his children so the LORD pitieth them that fear himFor he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dustAs for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourishethFor the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no moreBut the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto childrens childrenTo such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do themThe LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over allBless the LORD ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his wordBless ye the LORD all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasureBless the LORD all his works in all places of his dominion bless the LORD O my soulBless the LORD O my soul O LORD my God thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majestyWho coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtainWho layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the windWho maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fireWho laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for everThou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountainsAt thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted awayThey go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for themThou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earthHe sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hillsThey give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirstBy them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branchesHe watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy worksHe causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earthAnd wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth mans heartThe trees of the LORD are full of sap the cedars of Lebanon which he hath plantedWhere the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her houseThe high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the coniesHe appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going downThou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forthThe young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from GodThe sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them down in their densMan goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the eveningO LORD how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy richesSo is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beastsThere go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to play thereinThese wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due seasonThat thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with goodThou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dustThou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earthThe glory of the LORD shall endure for ever the LORD shall rejoice in his worksHe looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the hills and they smokeI will sing unto the LORD as long as I live I will sing praise to my God while I have my beingMy meditation of him shall be sweet I will be glad in the LORDLet the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the wicked be no more Bless thou the LORD O my soul Praise ye the LORDO give thanks unto the LORD call upon his name make known his deeds among the peopleSing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous worksGlory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORDSeek the LORD and his strength seek his face evermoreRemember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouthO ye seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his chosenHe is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earthHe hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generationsWhich covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto IsaacAnd confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an everlasting covenantSaying Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritanceWhen they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in itWhen they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another peopleHe suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakesSaying Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harmMoreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of breadHe sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servantWhose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in ironUntil the time that his word came the word of the LORD tried himThe king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go freeHe made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substanceTo bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdomIsrael also came into Egypt and Jacob sojourned in the land of HamAnd he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemiesHe turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servantsHe sent Moses his servant and Aaron whom he had chosenThey shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of HamHe sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his wordHe turned their waters into blood and slew their fishTheir land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kingsHe spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coastsHe gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their landHe smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coastsHe spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without numberAnd did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their groundHe smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strengthHe brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribesEgypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon themHe spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the nightThe people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heavenHe opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a riverFor he remembered his holy promise and Abraham his servantAnd he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladnessAnd gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the labour of the peopleThat they might observe his statutes and keep his laws Praise ye the LORDPraise ye the LORD O give thanks unto the LORD for he is good for his mercy endureth for everWho can utter the mighty acts of the LORD who can shew forth all his praiseBlessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all timesRemember me O LORD with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people O visit me with thy salvationThat I may see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I may glory with thine inheritanceWe have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedlyOur fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red seaNevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he might make his mighty power to be knownHe rebuked the Red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wildernessAnd he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemyAnd the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them leftThen believed they his words they sang his praiseThey soon forgat his works they waited not for his counselBut lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desertAnd he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soulThey envied Moses also in the camp and Aaron the saint of the LORDThe earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of AbiramAnd a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wickedThey made a calf in Horeb and worshipped the molten imageThus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grassThey forgat God their saviour which had done great things in EgyptWondrous works in the land of Ham and terrible things by the Red seaTherefore he said that he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy themYea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his wordBut murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORDTherefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wildernessTo overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the landsThey joined themselves also unto Baal-peor and ate the sacrifices of the deadThus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague brake in upon themThen stood up Phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayedAnd that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermoreThey angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakesBecause they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lipsThey did not destroy the nations concerning whom the LORD commanded themBut were mingled among the heathen and learned their worksAnd they served their idols which were a snare unto themYea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devilsAnd shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan and the land was polluted with bloodThus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventionsTherefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritanceAnd he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that hated them ruled over themTheir enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their handMany times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquityNevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cryAnd he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his merciesHe made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captivesSave us O LORD our God and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praiseBlessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say Amen Praise ye the LORDO give thanks unto the LORD for he is good for his mercy endureth for everLet the redeemed of the LORD say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemyAnd gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the southThey wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell inHungry and thirsty their soul fainted in themThen they cried unto the LORD in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distressesAnd he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitationOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of menFor he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodnessSuch as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and ironBecause they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the counsel of the most HighTherefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to helpThen they cried unto the LORD in their trouble and he saved them out of their distressesHe brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunderOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of menFor he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunderFools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflictedTheir soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of deathThen they cry unto the LORD in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distressesHe sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructionsOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of menAnd let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicingThey that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great watersThese see the works of the LORD and his wonders in the deepFor he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereofThey mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of troubleThey reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits endThen they cry unto the LORD in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distressesHe maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are stillThen are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired havenOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of menLet them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the eldersHe turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry groundA fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell thereinHe turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into waterspringsAnd there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitationAnd sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increaseHe blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decreaseAgain they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrowHe poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no wayYet setteth he the poor on

like oil into his bonesLet it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continuallyLet this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD and of them that

daughter of Babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served usHappy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stonesI will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I sing praise unto theeI will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy nameIn the day when I cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soulAll the kings of the earth shall praise thee O LORD when they hear the words of thy mouthYea they shall sing in the ways of the LORD for great is the glory of the LORDThough the LORD be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar offThough I walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save meThe LORD will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy O LORD endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own handsO LORD thou hast searched me and known meThou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar offThou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my waysFor there is not a word in my tongue but lo O LORD thou knowest it altogetherThou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon meSuch knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto itWhither shall I go from thy spirit or whither shall I flee from thy presenceIf I ascend up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art thereIf I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the seaEven there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold meIf I say Surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about meYea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to theeFor thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my mothers wombI will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right wellMy substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earthThine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of themHow precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of themIf I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with theeSurely thou wilt slay the wicked O God depart from me therefore ye bloody menFor they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take thy name in vainDo not I hate them O LORD that hate thee and am not I grieved with those that rise up against theeI hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemiesSearch me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughtsAnd see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlastingDeliver me O LORD from the evil man preserve me from the violent manWhich imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they gathered together for warThey have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison is under their lips SelahKeep me O LORD from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goingsThe proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me SelahI said unto the LORD Thou art my God hear the voice of my supplications O LORDO GOD the Lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battleGrant not O LORD the desires of the wicked further not his wicked device lest they exalt themselves SelahAs for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover themLet burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits that they rise not up againLet not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow himI know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poorSurely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presenceLORD I cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when I cry unto theeLet my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrificeSet a watch O LORD before my mouth keep the door of my lipsIncline not my heart to any evil thing to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their daintiesLet the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamitiesWhen their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweetOur bones are scattered at the graves mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earthBut mine eyes are unto thee O GOD the Lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destituteKeep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the gins of the workers of iniquityLet the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that I withal escapeI cried unto the LORD with my voice with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplicationI poured out my complaint before him I shewed before him my troubleWhen my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for meI looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soulI cried unto thee O LORD I said Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the livingAttend unto my cry for I am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than IBring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with meHear my prayer O LORD give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousnessAnd enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justifiedFor the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long deadTherefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolateI remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I muse on the work of thy handsI stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land SelahHear me speedily O LORD my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest I be like unto them that go down into the pitCause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do I trust cause me to know the way wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul unto theeDeliver me O LORD from mine enemies I flee unto thee to hide meTeach me to do thy will for thou art my God thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightnessQuicken me O LORD for thy names sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of troubleAnd of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servantBlessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fightMy goodness and my

healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their woundsHe telleth the number of the stars he calleth them all by their namesGreat is our Lord and of great power his understanding is infiniteThe LORD lifteth up the meek he casteth the wicked down to the groundSing unto the LORD with thanksgiving sing praise upon the harp unto our GodWho covereth the heaven with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth who maketh grass to grow upon the mountainsHe giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cryHe delighteth not in the strength of the horse he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a

passPraise the LORD from the earth ye dragons and all deepsFire and hail snow and vapour stormy wind fulfilling his wordMountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedarsBeasts and all cattle creeping things and flying fowlKings of the earth and all people princes and all judges of the earthBoth young men and maidens old men and childrenLet them praise the name of the LORD for his name alone is excellent his glory is above the earth and heavenHe also exalteth the horn of his people the praise of all his saints even of the children of Israel a people near unto him Praise ye the LORDPraise ye the LORD Sing unto the LORD a new song and his praise in the congregation of saintsLet Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their KingLet them praise

them sing aloud upon their bedsLet the high praises of God be in their mouth and a twoedged sword in their handTo execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the peopleTo bind their kings

the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organsPraise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbalsLet every thing that hath breath praise the LORD Praise ye the LORDThe proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of IsraelTo know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understandingTo receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equityTo give subtilty to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretionA wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counselsTo understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayingsThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instructionMy son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy motherFor they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neckMy son if sinners entice thee consent thou notIf they say Come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without causeLet us swallow them up alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pitWe shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoilCast in thy lot among us let us all have one purseMy son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their pathFor their feet run to evil and make haste to shed bloodSurely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any birdAnd they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own livesSo are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereofWisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streetsShe crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words sayingHow long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledgeTurn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make known my words unto youBecause I have called and ye refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regardedBut ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproofI also will laugh at your calamity I will mock when your fear comethWhen your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon youThen shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find meFor that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORDThey would none of my counsel they despised all my reproofTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devicesFor the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy themBut whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evilMy son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with theeSo that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understandingYea if thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understandingIf thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasuresThen shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of GodFor the LORD giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understandingHe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightlyHe keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saintsThen shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good pathWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soulDiscretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep theeTo deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh froward thingsWho leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darknessWho rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wickedWhose ways are crooked and they froward in their pathsTo deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her wordsWhich forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her GodFor her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the deadNone that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the paths of lifeThat thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteousFor the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in itBut the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgressors shall be rooted out of itMy son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandmentsFor length of days and long life and peace shall they add to theeLet not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heartSo shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and manTrust in the LORD with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understandingIn all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy pathsBe not wise in thine own eyes fear the LORD and depart from evilIt shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bonesHonour the LORD with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increaseSo shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wineMy son despise not the chastening of the LORD neither be weary of his correctionFor whom the LORD loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delightethHappy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understandingFor the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine goldShe is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto herLength of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honourHer ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peaceThe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth herThe LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath he established the heavensBy his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dewMy son let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom and discretionSo shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neckThen shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumbleWhen thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweetBe not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it comethFor the LORD shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being takenWithhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do itSay not unto thy neighbour Go and come again and to morrow I will give when thou hast it by theeDevise not evil against thy neighbour seeing he dwelleth securely by theeStrive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harmEnvy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his waysFor the froward is abomination to the LORD but his secret is with the righteousThe curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked but he blesseth the habitation of the justSurely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the lowlyThe wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of foolsHear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to know understandingFor I give you good doctrine forsake ye not my lawFor I was my fathers son tender and only beloved in the sight of my motherHe taught me also and said unto me Let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and liveGet wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouthForsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep theeWisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understandingExalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace herShe shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to theeHear O my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be manyI have taught thee in the way of wisdom I have led thee in right pathsWhen thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not stumbleTake fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy lifeEnter not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil menAvoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass awayFor they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fallFor they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violenceBut the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect dayThe way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumbleMy son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayingsLet them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heartFor they are life unto those that find them and health to all their fleshKeep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of lifePut away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from theeLet thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before theePonder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be establishedTurn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evilMy son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understandingThat thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledgeFor the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oilBut her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a twoedged swordHer feet go down to death her steps take hold on hellLest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are moveable that thou canst not know themHear me now therefore O ye children and depart not from the words of my mouthRemove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her houseLest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruelLest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labours be in the house of a strangerAnd thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumedAnd say How have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproofAnd have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed meI was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assemblyDrink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own wellLet thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streetsLet them be only thine own and not strangers with theeLet thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youthLet her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her loveAnd why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a strangerFor the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD and he pondereth all his goingsHis own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holden with the cords of his sinsHe shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astrayMy son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a strangerThou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouthDo this now my son deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friendGive not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelidsDeliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowlerGo to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wiseWhich having no guide overseer or rulerProvideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvestHow long wilt thou sleep O sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepYet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleepSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed manA naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouthHe winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingersFrowardness is in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discordTherefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedyThese six things doth the LORD hate yea seven are an abomination unto himA proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent bloodAn heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischiefA false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethrenMy son keep thy fathers commandment and forsake not the law of thy motherBind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neckWhen thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with theeFor the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of lifeTo keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange womanLust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelidsFor by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious lifeCan a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burnedCan one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burnedSo he that goeth in to his neighbours wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocentMen do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungryBut if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his houseBut whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soulA wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped awayFor jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeanceHe will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many giftsMy son keep my words and lay up my commandments with theeKeep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eyeBind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heartSay unto wisdom Thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswomanThat they may keep thee from the strange woman from the stranger which flattereth with her wordsFor at the window of my house I looked through my casementAnd beheld among the simple ones I discerned among the youths a young man void of understandingPassing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her houseIn the twilight in the evening in the black and dark nightAnd behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heartShe is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her houseNow is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every cornerSo she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto himI have peace offerings with me this day have I payed my vowsTherefore came I forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and I have found theeI have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linen of EgyptI have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamonCome let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with lovesFor the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journeyHe hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointedWith her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced himHe goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocksTill a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his lifeHearken unto me now therefore O ye children and attend to the words of my mouthLet not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her pathsFor she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by herHer house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of deathDoth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voiceShe standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the pathsShe crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doorsUnto you O men I call and my voice is to the sons of manO ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an understanding heartHear for I will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right thingsFor my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lipsAll the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing froward or perverse in themThey are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledgeReceive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice goldFor wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to itI wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventionsThe fear of the LORD is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hateCounsel is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding I have strengthBy me kings reign and princes decree justiceBy me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earthI love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find meRiches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousnessMy fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silverI lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgmentThat I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and I will fill their treasuresThe LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of oldI was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth wasWhen there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with waterBefore the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forthWhile as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the worldWhen he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depthWhen he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deepWhen he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earthThen I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before himRejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of menNow therefore hearken unto me O ye children for blessed are they that keep my waysHear instruction and be wise and refuse it notBlessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doorsFor whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the LORDBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love deathWisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillarsShe hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her tableShe hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the cityWhoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to himCome eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingledForsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understandingHe that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blotReprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love theeGive instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learningThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understandingFor by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increasedIf thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear itA foolish woman is clamourous she is simple and knoweth nothingFor she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the cityTo call passengers who go right on their waysWhoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to himStolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasantBut he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hellThe proverbs of Solomon A wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his motherTreasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from deathThe LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wickedHe becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh richHe that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shameBlessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth the mouth of the wickedThe memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rotThe wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fallHe that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth his ways shall be knownHe that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool shall fallThe mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wickedHatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sinsIn the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understandingWise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destructionThe rich mans wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their povertyThe labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the wicked to sinHe is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that refuseth reproof errethHe that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a foolIn the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he that

is not good to have respect of persons in judgmentHe that saith unto the wicked Thou are righteous him shall the people curse nations shall abhor himBut to them that rebuke him shall be delight and a good blessing shall come upon themEvery man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answerPrepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build thine houseBe not a witness against thy neighbour without cause and deceive not with thy lipsSay not I will do so to him as he hath done to me I will render to the man according to his workI went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understandingAnd lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken downThen I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instructionYet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleepSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed manThese are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied outIt is the glory of God to conceal a thing but the honour of kings is to search out a matterThe heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of kings is unsearchableTake away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the finerTake away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousnessPut not forth thyself in the presence of the king and stand not in the place of great menFor better it is that it be said unto thee Come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seenGo not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shameDebate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not a secret to anotherLest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infamy turn not awayA word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silverAs an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a wise reprover upon an obedient earAs the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful messenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of his mastersWhoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rainBy long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tongue breaketh the boneHast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit itWithdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house lest he be weary of thee and so hate theeA man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrowConfidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of jointAs he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar upon nitre so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heartIf thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drinkFor thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head and the LORD shall reward theeThe north wind driveth away rain so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongueIt is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman and in a wide houseAs cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far countryA righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt springIt is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own glory is not gloryHe that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without wallsAs snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not seemly for a foolAs the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse causeless shall not comeA whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the fools backAnswer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto himAnswer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceitHe that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet and drinketh damageThe legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth of foolsAs he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth honour to a foolAs a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouth of foolsThe great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth transgressorsAs a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his follySeest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of himThe slothful man saith There is a lion in the way a lion is in the streetsAs the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon his bedThe slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouthThe sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reasonHe that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to him is like one that taketh a dog by the earsAs a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and deathSo is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith Am not I in sportWhere no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no talebearer the strife ceasethAs coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a contentious man to kindle strifeThe words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the bellyBurning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver drossHe that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceit within himWhen he speaketh fair believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heartWhose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregationWhoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it will return upon himA lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flattering mouth worketh ruinBoast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forthLet another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lipsA stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them bothWrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand before envyOpen rebuke is better than secret loveFaithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitfulThe full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweetAs a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from his placeOintment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of a mans friend by hearty counselThine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neither go into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far offMy son be wise and make my heart glad that I may answer him that reproacheth meA prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punishedTake his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange womanHe that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early in the morning it shall be counted a curse to himA continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alikeWhosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth itselfIron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friendWhoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he that waiteth on his master shall be honouredAs in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to manHell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfiedAs the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praiseThough thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle yet will not his foolishness depart from himBe thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herdsFor riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure to every generationThe hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth itself and herbs of the mountains are gatheredThe lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of the fieldAnd thou shalt have goats milk enough for thy food for the food of thy household and for the maintenance for thy maidensThe wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lionFor the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolongedA poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no foodThey that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with themEvil men understand not judgment but they that seek the LORD understand all thingsBetter is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be richWhoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his fatherHe that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poorHe that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be abominationWhoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way he shall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have good things in possessionThe rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him outWhen righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but when the wicked rise a man is hiddenHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercyHappy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischiefAs a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler over the poor peopleThe prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his daysA man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit let no man stay himWhoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at onceHe that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enoughA faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocentTo have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgressHe that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon himHe that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongueWhoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith It is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyerHe that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fatHe that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be deliveredHe that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curseWhen the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increaseHe that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedyWhen the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mournWhoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substanceThe king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth itA man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feetIn the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the righteous doth sing and rejoiceThe righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wicked regardeth not to know itScornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn away wrathIf a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or laugh there is no restThe bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soulA fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwardsIf a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wickedThe poor and the deceitful man meet together the LORD lighteneth both their eyesThe king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for everThe rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shameWhen the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but the righteous shall see their fallCorrect thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soulWhere there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is heA servant will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not answerSeest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of himHe that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the lengthAn angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in transgressionA mans pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the humble in spiritWhoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth cursing and bewrayeth it notThe fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safeMany seek the rulers favour but every mans judgment cometh from the LORDAn unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wickedThe words of Agur the son of Jakeh even the prophecy the man spake unto Ithiel even unto Ithiel and UcalSurely I am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a manI neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holyWho hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his sons name if thou canst tellEvery word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in himAdd thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liarTwo things have I required of thee deny me them not before I dieRemove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for meLest I be full and deny thee and say Who is the LORD or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of my God in vainAccuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guiltyThere is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their motherThere is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their filthinessThere is a generation O how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted upThere is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among menThe horseleach hath two daughters crying Give give There are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not It is enoughThe grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not It is enoughThe eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat itThere be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which I know notThe way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maidSuch is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickednessFor three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it cannot bearFor a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he is filled with meatFor an odious woman when she is married and an handmaid that is heir to her mistressThere be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wiseThe ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summerThe conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocksThe locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bandsThe spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palacesThere be three things which go well yea four are comely in goingA lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for anyA greyhound an he goat also and a king against whom there is no rising upIf thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouthSurely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strifeThe words of king Lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught himWhat my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vowsGive not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kingsIt is not for kings O Lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drinkLest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflictedGive strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy heartsLet him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no moreOpen thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destructionOpen thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needyWho can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubiesThe heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoilShe will do him good and not evil all the days of her lifeShe seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her handsShe is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afarShe riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidensShe considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyardShe girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her armsShe perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by nightShe layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaffShe stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needyShe is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarletShe maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purpleHer husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the landShe maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchantStrength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to comeShe openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindnessShe looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idlenessHer children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth herMany daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them allFavour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the LORD she shall be praisedGive her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gatesThe words of the Preacher the son of David king in JerusalemVanity of vanities saith the Preacher vanity of vanities all is vanityWhat profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sunOne generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for everThe sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he aroseThe wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuitsAll the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return againAll things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearingThe thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sunIs there any thing whereof it may be said See this is new it hath been already of old time which was before usThere is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come afterI the Preacher was king over Israel in JerusalemAnd I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewithI have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spiritThat which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numberedI communed with mine own heart saying Lo I am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledgeAnd I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly I perceived that this also is vexation of spiritFor in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrowI said in mine heart Go to now I will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanityI said of laughter It is mad and of mirth What doeth itI sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till I might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their lifeI made me great works I builded me houses I planted me vineyardsI made me gardens and orchards and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruitsI made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth treesI got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before meI gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces I gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sortsSo I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with meAnd whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and this was my portion of all my labourThen I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sunAnd I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already doneThen I saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darknessThe wise mans eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them allThen said I in my heart As it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why was I then more wise Then I said in my heart that this also is vanityFor there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten And how dieth the wise man as the foolTherefore I hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spiritYea I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after meAnd who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun This is also vanityTherefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sunFor there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion This also is vanity and a great evilFor what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sunFor all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in the night This is also vanityThere is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour This also I saw that it was from the hand of GodFor who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than IFor God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that is good before God This also is vanity and vexation of spiritTo every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavenA time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is plantedA time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build upA time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to danceA time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracingA time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast awayA time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speakA time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peaceWhat profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labourethI have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in itHe hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the endI know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his lifeAnd also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour it is the gift of GodI know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before himThat which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is pastAnd moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity was thereI said in mine heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every workI said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beastsFor that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanityAll go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust againWho knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earthWherefore I perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after himSo I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforterWherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet aliveYea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sunAgain I considered all travail and every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbour This is also vanity and vexation of spiritThe fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own fleshBetter is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spiritThen I returned and I saw vanity under the sunThere is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good This is also vanity yea it is a sore travailTwo are better than one because they have a good reward for their labourFor if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him upAgain if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm aloneAnd if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly brokenBetter is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonishedFor out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poorI considered all the living which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in his steadThere is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spiritKeep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evilBe not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God for God is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be fewFor a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fools voice is known by multitude of wordsWhen thou vowest a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowedBetter is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not paySuffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefore should God be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine handsFor in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but fear thou GodIf thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than theyMoreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the fieldHe that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanityWhen goods increase they are increased that eat them and what good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with their eyesThe sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleepThere is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurtBut those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is nothing in his handAs he came forth of his mothers womb naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his handAnd this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the windAll his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sicknessBehold that which I have seen it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life which God giveth him for it is his portionEvery man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of GodFor he shall not much remember the days of his life because God answereth him in the joy of his heartThere is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is common among menA man to whom God hath given riches wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil diseaseIf a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good and also that he have no burial I say that an untimely birth is better than heFor he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his name shall be covered with darknessMoreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath more rest than the otherYea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seen no good do not all go to one placeAll the labour of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filledFor what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the livingBetter is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spiritThat which hath been is named already and it is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than heSeeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the betterFor who knoweth what is good for man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sunA good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of ones birthIt is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heartSorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made betterThe heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirthIt is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of foolsFor as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanitySurely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heartBetter is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spiritBe not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of foolsSay not thou What is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning thisWisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the sunFor wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have itConsider the work of God for who can make that straight which he hath made crookedIn the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider God also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after himAll things have I seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickednessBe not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyselfBe not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy timeIt is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth God shall come forth of them allWisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the cityFor there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth notAlso take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse theeFor oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed othersAll this have I proved by wisdom I said I will be wise but it was far from meThat which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it outI applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madnessAnd I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by herBehold this have I found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the accountWhich yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not foundLo this only have I found that God hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventionsWho is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changedI counsel thee to keep the kings commandment and that in regard of the oath of GodBe not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth himWhere the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him What doest thouWhoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgmentBecause to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon himFor he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall beThere is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to itAll this have I seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurtAnd so I saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this is also vanityBecause sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evilThough a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God which fear before himBut it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before GodThere is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous I said that this also is vanityThen I commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life which God giveth him under the sunWhen I applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyesThen I beheld all the work of God that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea further though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find itFor all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before themAll things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oathThis is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the deadFor to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a living dog is better than a dead lionFor the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgottenAlso their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sunGo thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepteth thy worksLet thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no ointmentLive joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sunWhatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goestI returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them allFor man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon themThis wisdom have I seen also under the sun and it seemed great unto meThere was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against itNow there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor manThen said I Wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heardThe words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among foolsWisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth much goodDead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honourA wise mans heart is at his right hand but a fools heart at his leftYea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a foolIf the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yielding pacifieth great offencesThere is an evil which I have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the rulerFolly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in low placeI have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earthHe that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge a serpent shall bite himWhoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered therebyIf the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to directSurely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no betterThe words of a wise mans mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himselfThe beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madnessA fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell himThe labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the cityWoe to thee O land when thy king is a child and thy princes eat in the morningBlessed art thou O land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkennessBy much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth throughA feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all thingsCurse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matterCast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many daysGive a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earthIf the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall beHe that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reapAs thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh allIn the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike goodTruly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sunBut if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many All that cometh is vanityRejoice O young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgmentTherefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanityRemember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in themWhile the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rainIn the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkenedAnd the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of musick shall be brought lowAlso when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streetsOr ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cisternThen shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave itVanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanityAnd moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbsThe preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truthThe words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherdAnd further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the fleshLet us hear the conclusion of the whole matter Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of manFor God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evilThe song of songs which is SolomonsLet him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wineBecause of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love theeDraw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love theeI am black but comely O ye daughters of Jerusalem as the tents of Kedar as the curtains of SolomonLook not upon me because I am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have I not keptTell me O thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companionsIf thou know not O thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tentsI have compared thee O my love to a company of horses in Pharaohs chariotsThy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains of goldWe will make thee borders of gold with studs of silverWhile the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereofA bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie all night betwixt my breastsMy beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gediBehold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyesBehold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is greenThe beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of firI am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleysAs the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughtersAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons I sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my tasteHe brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was loveStay me with flagons comfort me with apples for I am sick of loveHis left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace meI charge you O ye daughters of Jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he pleaseThe voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hillsMy beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself through the latticeMy beloved spake and said unto me Rise up my love my fair one and come awayFor lo the winter is past the rain is over and goneThe flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our landThe fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell Arise my love my fair one and come awayO my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comelyTake us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapesMy beloved is mine and I am his he feedeth among the liliesUntil the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of BetherBy night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth I sought him but I found him notI will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth I sought him but I found him notThe watchmen that go about the city found me to whom I said Saw ye him whom my soul lovethIt was but a little that I passed from them but I found him whom my soul loveth I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mothers house and into the chamber of her that conceived meI charge you O ye daughters of Jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he pleaseWho is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchantBehold his bed which is Solomons threescore valiant men are about it of the valiant of IsraelThey all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the nightKing Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of LebanonHe made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of JerusalemGo forth O ye daughters of Zion and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heartBehold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks

get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincenseThou art all fair my love there is no spot in theeCome with me from Lebanon my spouse with me from Lebanon look from the top of Amana

have put off my coat how shall I put it on I have washed my feet how shall I defile themMy beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door and my bowels were moved for himI rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lockI opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake I sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave me no answerThe watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from meI charge you O daughters of Jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that I am sick of loveWhat is thy beloved more than another beloved O thou fairest among women what is thy

cedarsHis mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely This is my beloved and this is my friend O daughters of JerusalemWhither is thy beloved gone O thou fairest among women whither is thy beloved

among the liliesThou art beautiful O my love as Tirzah comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army with bannersTurn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me thy hair is as a flock of goats that

within thy locksThere are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without numberMy dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bare her The daughters saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they praised herWho is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with bannersI went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates buddedOr ever I was aware my soul made me like the chariots of AmminadibReturn return O Shulamite return return that we may look upon thee What will ye see in the Shulamite As it were the company of two armiesHow beautiful are thy feet with shoes O princes

liliesThy two breasts are like two young roes that are twinsThy neck is as a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward DamascusThine head upon thee is like Carmel and the hair of thine head like purple the king is held in the galleriesHow fair and how pleasant art thou O love for delightsThis thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters of grapesI said I will go up to the palm tree I will take hold of the boughs thereof now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like applesAnd the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly causing the lips of those that are asleep to speakI am my beloveds and his desire is toward meCome my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in the villagesLet us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth there will I give thee my lovesThe mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which I have laid up for thee O my belovedO that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother when I should find thee without I would kiss thee yea I should not be despisedI would lead thee and bring thee into my mothers house who would instruct me I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranateHis left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace meI charge you O daughters of Jerusalem that ye stir not up nor awake my love until he pleaseWho is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare theeSet me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flameMany waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemnedWe have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken forIf she be a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a door we will inclose her with boards of cedarI am a wall and my breasts like towers then was I in his eyes as one that found favourSolomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon he let out the vineyard unto keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silverMy vineyard which is mine is before me thou O Solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundredThou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice cause me to hear itMake haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spicesThe vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of JudahHear O heavens and give ear O earth for the LORD hath spoken I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against meThe ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but Israel doth not know my people doth not considerAh sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the LORD they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger they are gone away backwardWhy should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faintFrom the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointmentYour country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangersAnd the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged cityExcept the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as Sodom and we should have been like unto GomorrahHear the word of the LORD ye rulers of Sodom give ear unto the law of our God ye people of GomorrahTo what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the LORD I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and I delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goatsWhen ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courtsBring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies I cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meetingYour new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me I am weary to bear themAnd when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers I will not hear your hands are full of bloodWash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evilLearn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widowCome now and let us reason together saith the LORD though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as woolIf ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the landBut if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken itHow is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderersThy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with waterThy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto themTherefore saith the Lord the LORD of hosts the mighty One of Israel Ah I will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemiesAnd I will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tinAnd I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellers as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness the faithful cityZion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousnessAnd the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumedFor they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosenFor ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no waterAnd the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench themthe word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and JerusalemAnd it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the LORDs house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto itAnd many people shall go and say Come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD to the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the LORD from JerusalemAnd he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any moreO house of Jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the LORDTherefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the Philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangersTheir land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariotsTheir land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have madeAnd the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them notEnter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the LORD and for the glory of his majestyThe lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that dayFor the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought lowAnd upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of BashanAnd upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted upAnd upon every high tower and upon every fenced wallAnd upon all the ships of Tarshish and upon all pleasant picturesAnd the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that dayAnd the idols he shall utterly abolishAnd they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the LORD and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earthIn that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the batsTo go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the LORD and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earthCease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted ofFor behold the Lord the LORD of hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of waterThe mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancientThe captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counseller and the cunning artificer and the eloquent oratorAnd I will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over themAnd the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourableWhen a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying Thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy handIn that day shall he swear saying I will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the peopleFor Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD to provoke the eyes of his gloryThe shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as Sodom they hide it not Woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselvesSay ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doingsWoe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given himAs for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them O my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy pathsThe LORD standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the peopleThe LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your housesWhat mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the LORD GOD of hostsMoreover the LORD saith Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feetTherefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion and the LORD will discover their secret partsIn that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moonThe chains and the bracelets and the mufflersThe bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earringsThe rings and nose jewelsThe changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pinsThe glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vailsAnd it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beautyThy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the warAnd her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the groundAnd in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproachIn that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of IsraelAnd it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in JerusalemWhen the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burningAnd the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defenceAnd there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rainNow will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hillAnd he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapesAnd now O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah judge I pray you betwixt me and my vineyardWhat could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapesAnd now go to I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard I will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden downAnd I will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon itFor the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel and the men of Judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cryWoe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earthIn mine ears said the LORD of hosts Of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitantYea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephahWoe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame themAnd the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the LORD neither consider the operation of his handsTherefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirstTherefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into itAnd the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbledBut the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousnessThen shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eatWoe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart ropeThat say Let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come that we may know itWoe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitterWoe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sightWoe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drinkWhich justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from himTherefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of IsraelTherefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets For all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out stillAnd he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftlyNone shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be brokenWhose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwindTheir roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver itAnd in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereofIn the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the templeAbove it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did flyAnd one cried unto another and said Holy holy holy is the LORD of hosts the whole earth is full of his gloryAnd the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smokeThen said I Woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the King the LORD of hostsThen flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altarAnd he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purgedAlso I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom shall I send and who will go for us Then said I Here am I send meAnd he said Go and tell this people Hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive notMake the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healedThen said I Lord how long And he answered Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolateAnd the LORD have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the landBut yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereofAnd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah that Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel went up toward Jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against itAnd it was told the house of David saying Syria is confederate with Ephraim And his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the windThen said the LORD unto Isaiah Go forth now to meet Ahaz thou and Shear-jashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers fieldAnd say unto him Take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria and of the son of RemaliahBecause Syria Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee sayingLet us go up against Judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of TabealThus saith the Lord GOD It shall not stand neither shall it come to passFor the head of Syria is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a peopleAnd the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son If ye will not believe surely ye shall not be establishedMoreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz sayingAsk thee a sign of the LORD thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height aboveBut Ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the LORDAnd he said Hear ye now O house of David Is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my God alsoTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name ImmanuelButter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the goodFor before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kingsThe LORD shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy fathers house days that have not come from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah even the king of AssyriaAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of AssyriaAnd they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushesIn the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of Assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beardAnd it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheepAnd it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the landAnd it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thornsWith arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thornsAnd on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattleMoreover the LORD said unto me Take thee a great roll and write in it with a mans pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-bazAnd I took unto me faithful witnesses to record Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of JeberechiahAnd I went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son Then said the LORD to me Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-bazFor before the child shall have knowledge to cry My father and my mother the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of AssyriaThe LORD spake also unto me again sayingForasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliahs sonNow therefore behold the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of Assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banksAnd he shall pass through Judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land O ImmanuelAssociate yourselves O ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in piecesTake counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for God is with usFor the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people sayingSay ye not A confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say A confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraidSanctify the LORD of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dreadAnd he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of JerusalemAnd many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be takenBind up the testimony seal the law among my disciplesAnd I will wait upon the LORD that hideth his face from the house of Jacob and I will look for himBehold I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts which dwelleth in mount ZionAnd when they shall say unto you Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their God for the living to the deadTo the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in themAnd they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their God and look upwardAnd they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darknessNevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nationsThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shinedThou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoilFor thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of MidianFor every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fireFor unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counseller The mighty God The everlasting Father The Prince of PeaceOf the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform thisThe Lord sent a word into Jacob and it hath lighted upon IsraelAnd all the people shall know even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heartThe bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are cut down but we will change them into cedarsTherefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him and join his enemies togetherThe Syrians before and the Philistines behind and they shall devour Israel with open mouth For all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out stillFor the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do they seek the LORD of hostsTherefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail branch and rush in one dayThe ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tailFor the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyedTherefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly For all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out stillFor wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smokeThrough the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his brotherAnd he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own armManasseh Ephraim and Ephraim Manasseh and they together shall be against Judah For all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out stillWoe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribedTo turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherlessAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your gloryWithout me they shall bow down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain For all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out stillO Assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignationI will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streetsHowbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a fewFor he saith Are not my princes altogether kingsIs not Calno as Carchemish is not Hamath as Arpad is not Samaria as DamascusAs my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of SamariaShall I not as I have done unto Samaria and her idols so do to Jerusalem and her idolsWherefore it shall come to pass that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looksFor he saith By the strength of my hand I have done it and by my wisdom for I am prudent and I have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant manAnd my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have I gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peepedShall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no woodTherefore shall the Lord the Lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fireAnd the light of Israel shall be for a fire and his Holy One for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one dayAnd shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standardbearer faintethAnd the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write themAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the LORD the Holy One of Israel in truthThe remnant shall return even the remnant of Jacob unto the mighty GodFor though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousnessFor the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the landTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts O my people that dwellest in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of EgyptFor yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destructionAnd the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of EgyptAnd it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointingHe is come to Aiath he is passed to Migron at Michmash he hath laid up his carriagesThey are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at Geba Ramah is afraid Gibeah of Saul is fledLift up thy voice O daughter of Gallim cause it to be heard unto Laish O poor AnathothMadmenah is removed the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to fleeAs yet shall he remain at Nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion the hill of JerusalemBehold the Lord the LORD of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbledAnd he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty oneAnd there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a Branch shall grow out of his rootsAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORDAnd shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his earsBut with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wickedAnd righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reinsThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead themAnd the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the oxAnd the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice denThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the seaAnd in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be gloriousAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Cush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and from the islands of the seaAnd he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earthThe envy also of Ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off Ephraim shall not envy Judah and Judah shall not vex EphraimBut they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon shall obey themAnd the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshodAnd there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of EgyptAnd in that day thou shalt say O LORD I will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst meBehold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song he also is become my salvationTherefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvationAnd in that day shall ye say Praise the LORD call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exaltedSing unto the LORD for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earthCry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of theeThe burden of Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz did seeLift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the noblesI have commanded my sanctified ones I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highnessThe noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battleThey come from a far country from the end of heaven even the LORD and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole landHowl ye for the day of the LORD is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the AlmightyTherefore shall all hands be faint and every mans heart shall meltAnd they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flamesBehold the day of the LORD cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of itFor the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shineAnd I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terribleI will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of OphirTherefore I will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the LORD of hosts and in the day of his fierce angerAnd it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own landEvery one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the swordTheir children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravishedBehold I will stir up the Medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in itTheir bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare childrenAnd Babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the Chaldees excellency shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and GomorrahIt shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold thereBut wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance thereAnd the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolongedFor the LORD will have mercy on Jacob and will yet choose Israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of JacobAnd the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressorsAnd it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serveThat thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say How hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceasedThe LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulersHe who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hinderethThe whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singingYea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of Lebanon saying Since thou art laid down no feller is come up against usHell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nationsAll they shall speak and say unto thee Art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto usThy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover theeHow art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nationsFor thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the northI will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most HighYet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pitThey that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying Is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdomsThat made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisonersAll the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own houseBut thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feetThou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renownedPrepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with citiesFor I will rise up against them saith the LORD of hosts and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the LORDI will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the LORD of hostsThe LORD of hosts hath sworn saying Surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it standThat I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shouldersThis is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nationsFor the LORD of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it backIn the year that king Ahaz died was this burdenRejoice not thou whole Palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpentAnd the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and I will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnantHowl O gate cry O city thou whole Palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed timesWhat shall one then answer the messengers of the nation That the LORD hath founded Zion and the poor of his people shall trust in itThe burden of Moab Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silenceHe is gone up to Bajith and to Dibon the high places to weep Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut offIn their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantlyAnd Heshbon shall cry and Elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto himMy heart shall cry out for Moab his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destructionFor the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thingTherefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willowsFor the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab the howling thereof unto Eglaim and the howling thereof unto Beer-elimFor the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood for I will bring more upon Dimon lions upon him that escapeth of Moab and upon the remnant of the landSend ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of ZionFor it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of ArnonTake counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wanderethLet mine outcasts dwell with thee Moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the landAnd in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousnessWe have heard of the pride of Moab he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be soTherefore shall Moab howl for Moab every one shall howl for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn surely they are strickenFor the fields of Heshbon languish and the vine of Sibmah the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof they are come even unto Jazer they wandered through the wilderness her branches are stretched out they are gone over the seaTherefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah I will water thee with my tears O Heshbon and Elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallenAnd gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses I have made their vintage shouting to ceaseWherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab and mine inward parts for Kir-hareshAnd it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he shall not prevailThis is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that timeBut now the LORD hath spoken saying Within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of Moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feebleThe burden of Damascus Behold Damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heapThe cities of Aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraidThe fortress also shall cease from Ephraim and the kingdom from Damascus and the remnant of Syria they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel saith the LORD of hostsAnd in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax leanAnd it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of RephaimYet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the LORD God of IsraelAt that day shall a man look to his Maker and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of IsraelAnd he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the groves or the imagesIn that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of Israel and there shall be desolationBecause thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slipsIn the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrowWoe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty watersThe nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but God shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwindAnd behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is not This is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob usWoe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of EthiopiaThat sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters saying Go ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiledAll ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear yeFor so the LORD said unto me I will take my rest and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvestFor afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branchesThey shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon themIn that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts the mount ZionThe burden of Egypt Behold the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of itAnd I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdomAnd the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and I will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizardsAnd the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the Lord the LORD of hostsAnd the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried upAnd they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall witherThe paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no moreThe fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languishMoreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave networks shall be confoundedAnd they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fishSurely the princes of Zoan are fools the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto Pharaoh I am the son of the wise the son of ancient kingsWhere are they where are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon EgyptThe princes of Zoan are become fools the princes of Noph are deceived they have also seduced Egypt even they that are the stay of the tribes thereofThe LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomitNeither shall there be any work for Egypt which the head or tail branch or rush may doIn that day shall Egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts which he shaketh over itAnd the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts which he hath determined against itIn that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan and swear to the LORD of hosts one shall be called The city of destructionIn that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORDAnd it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver themAnd the LORD shall be known to Egypt and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the LORD and perform itAnd the LORD shall smite Egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the LORD and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal themIn that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt and the Egyptian into Assyria and the Egyptians shall serve with the AssyriansIn that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria even a blessing in the midst of the landWhom the LORD of hosts shall bless saying Blessed be Egypt my people and Assyria the work of my hands and Israel mine inheritanceIn the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and fought against Ashdod and took itAt the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz saying Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot And he did so walking naked and barefootAnd the LORD said Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon EthiopiaSo shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners and the Ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of EgyptAnd they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation and of Egypt their gloryAnd the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day Behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria and how shall we escapeThe burden of the desert of the sea As whirlwinds in the south pass through so it cometh from the desert from a terrible landA grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously and the spoiler spoileth Go up O Elam besiege O Media all the sighing thereof have I made to ceaseTherefore are my loins filled with pain pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth I was bowed down at the hearing of it I was dismayed at the seeing of itMy heart panted fearfulness affrighted me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto mePrepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint the shieldFor thus hath the Lord said unto me Go set a watchman let him declare what he seethAnd he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heedAnd he cried A lion My lord I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime and I am set in my ward whole nightsAnd behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen And he answered and said Babylon is fallen is fallen and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the groundO my threshing and the corn of my floor that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts the God of Israel have I declared unto youThe burden of Dumah He calleth to me out of Seir Watchman what of the night Watchman what of the nightThe watchman said The morning cometh and also the night if ye will inquire inquire ye return comeThe burden upon Arabia In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge O ye travelling companies of DedanimThe inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty they prevented with their bread him that fledFor they fled from the swords from the drawn sword and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of warFor thus hath the Lord said unto me Within a year according to the years of an hireling and all the glory of Kedar shall failAnd the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the children of Kedar shall be diminished for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken itThe burden of the valley of vision What aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetopsThou that art full of stirs a tumultuous city a joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battleAll thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from farTherefore said I Look away from me I will weep bitterly labour not to comfort me because of the spoiling of the daughter of my peopleFor it is a day of trouble and of treading down and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountainsAnd Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and Kir uncovered the shieldAnd it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gateAnd he discovered the covering of Judah and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forestYe have seen also the breaches of the city of David that they are many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower poolAnd ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wallYe made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long agoAnd in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackclothAnd behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall dieAnd it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the Lord GOD of hostsThus saith the Lord GOD of hosts Go get thee unto this treasurer even unto Shebna which is over the house and sayWhat hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rockBehold the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover theeHe will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lords houseAnd I will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall he pull thee downAnd it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of HilkiahAnd I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and I will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of JudahAnd the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall openAnd I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his fathers houseAnd they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagonsIn that day saith the LORD of hosts shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the LORD hath spoken itThe burden of Tyre Howl ye ships of Tarshish for it is laid waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of Chittim it is revealed to themBe still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of Zidon that pass over the sea have replenishedAnd by great waters the seed of Sihor the harvest of the river is her revenue and she is a mart of nationsBe thou ashamed O Zidon for the sea hath spoken even the strength of the sea saying I travail not nor bring forth children neither do I nourish up young men nor bring up virginsAs at the report concerning Egypt so shall they be sorely pained at the report of TyrePass ye over to Tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isleIs this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojournWho hath taken this counsel against Tyre the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earthThe LORD of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earthPass through thy land as a river O daughter of Tarshish there is no more strengthHe stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city to destroy the strong holds thereofAnd he said Thou shalt no more rejoice O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Zidon arise pass over to Chittim there also shalt thou have no restBehold the land of the Chaldeans this people was not till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought it to ruinHowl ye ships of Tarshish for your strength is laid wasteAnd it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlotTake an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be rememberedAnd it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that the LORD will visit Tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earthAnd her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD to eat sufficiently and for durable clothingBehold the LORD maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereofAnd it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to himThe land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the LORD hath spoken this wordThe earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languishThe earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenantTherefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men leftThe new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted do sighThe mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceasethThey shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink itThe city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come inThere is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is goneIn the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destructionWhen thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is doneThey shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD they shall cry aloud from the seaWherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the seaFrom the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous But I said My leanness my leanness woe unto me the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherouslyFear and the pit and the snare are upon thee O inhabitant of the earthAnd it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows from on high are open and the foundations of the earth do shakeThe earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedinglyThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise againAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earthAnd they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visitedThen the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his ancients gloriouslyO LORD thou art my God I will exalt thee I will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truthFor thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be builtTherefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear theeFor thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wallThou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought lowAnd in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refinedAnd he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nationsHe will swallow up death in victory and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the LORD hath spoken itAnd it shall be said in that day Lo this is our God we have waited for him and he will save us this is the LORD we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvationFor in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest and Moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the dunghillAnd he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their handsAnd the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dustIn that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah We have a strong city salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarksOpen ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter inThou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in theeTrust ye in the LORD for ever for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strengthFor he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dustThe foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needyThe way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost weigh the path of the justYea in the way of thy judgments O LORD have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of theeWith my soul have I desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will I seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousnessLet favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the LORDLORD when thy hand is lifted up they will not see but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people yea the fire of thine enemies shall devour themLORD thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought all our works in usO LORD our God other lords beside thee have had dominion over us but by thee only will we make mention of thy nameThey are dead they shall not live they are deceased they shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perishThou hast increased the nation O LORD thou hast increased the nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earthLORD in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon themLike as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in thy sight O LORDWe have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallenThy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the deadCome my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpastFor behold the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slainIn that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the seaIn that day sing ye unto her A vineyard of red wineI the LORD do keep it I will water it every moment lest any hurt it I will keep it night and dayFury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle I would go through them I would burn them togetherOr let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me and he shall make peace with meHe shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruitHath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by himIn measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east windBy this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged and this is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and images shall not stand upYet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereofWhen the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them and he that formed them will shew them no favourAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one O ye children of IsraelAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at JerusalemWoe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of Ephraim whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wineBehold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the handThe crown of pride the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feetAnd the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it upIn that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his peopleAnd for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gateBut they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgmentFor all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place cleanWhom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breastsFor precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a littleFor with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this peopleTo whom he said This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hearBut the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and takenWherefore hear the word of the LORD ye scornful men that rule this people which is in JerusalemBecause ye have said We have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselvesTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make hasteJudgment also will I lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding placeAnd your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by itFrom the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the reportFor the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in itFor the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange actNow therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earthGive ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speechDoth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his groundWhen he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their placeFor his God doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach himFor the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rodBread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horsemenThis also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts which is wonderful in counsel and excellent in workingWoe to Ariel to Ariel the city where David dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrificesYet I will distress Ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as ArielAnd I will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount and I will raise forts against theeAnd thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dustMoreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenlyThou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fireAnd the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night visionIt shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount ZionStay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drinkFor the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he coveredAnd the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying Read this I pray thee and he saith I cannot for it is sealedAnd the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying Read this I pray thee and he saith I am not learnedWherefore the Lord said Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of menTherefore behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidWoe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD and their works are in the dark and they say Who seeth us and who knoweth usSurely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him that made it He made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it He had no understandingIs it not yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forestAnd in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darknessThe meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of IsraelFor the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut offThat make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of noughtTherefore thus saith the LORD who redeemed Abraham concerning the house of Jacob Jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax paleBut when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and shall fear the God of IsraelThey also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrineWoe to the rebellious children saith the LORD that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sinThat walk to go down into Egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of EgyptTherefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusionFor his princes were at Zoan and his ambassadors came to HanesThey were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproachThe burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit themFor the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have I cried concerning this Their strength is to sit stillNow go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and everThat this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the LORDWhich say to the seers See not and to the prophets Prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceitsGet you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before usWherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel Because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereonTherefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instantAnd he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pitFor thus saith the Lord GOD the Holy One of Israel In returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would notBut ye said No for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and We will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swiftOne thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hillAnd therefore will the LORD wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the LORD is a God of judgment blessed are all they that wait for himFor the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer theeAnd though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachersAnd thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying This is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the leftYe shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it Get thee henceThen shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pasturesThe oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fanAnd there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fallMoreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their woundBehold the name of the LORD cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fireAnd his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to errYe shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD to the mighty One of IsraelAnd the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstonesFor through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rodAnd in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the LORD shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with itFor Tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the LORD like a stream of brimstone doth kindle itWoe to them that go down to Egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel neither seek the LORDYet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquityNow the Egyptians are men and not God and their horses flesh and not spirit When the LORD shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail togetherFor thus hath the LORD spoken unto me Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion and for the hill thereofAs birds flying so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve itTurn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revoltedFor in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sinThen shall the Assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfitedAnd he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the LORD whose fire is in Zion and his furnace in JerusalemBehold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgmentAnd a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary landAnd the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearkenThe heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainlyThe vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountifulFor the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the LORD to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to failThe instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh rightBut the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he standRise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speechMany days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not comeTremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loinsThey shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vineUpon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous cityBecause the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocksUntil the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field be counted for a forestThen judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful fieldAnd the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for everAnd my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting placesWhen it shall hail coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low placeBlessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the assWoe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with theeO LORD be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of troubleAt the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scatteredAnd your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon themThe LORD is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousnessAnd wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the LORD is his treasureBehold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterlyThe highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no manThe earth mourneth and languisheth Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down Sharon is like a wilderness and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruitsNow will I rise saith the LORD now will I be exalted now will I lift up myselfYe shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath as fire shall devour youAnd the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fireHear ye that are far off what I have done and ye that are near acknowledge my mightThe sinners in Zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us shall dwell with everlasting burningsHe that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evilHe shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall be sureThine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far offThine heart shall meditate terror Where is the scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towersThou shalt not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understandLook upon Zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be brokenBut there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass therebyFor the LORD is our judge the LORD is our lawgiver the LORD is our king he will save usThy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great spoil divided the lame take the preyAnd the inhabitant shall not say I am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquityCome near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of itFor the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughterTheir slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their bloodAnd all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig treeFor my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon Idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgmentThe sword of the LORD is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of IdumeaAnd the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatnessFor it is the day of the LORDs vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversy of ZionAnd the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitchIt shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and everBut the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptinessThey shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothingAnd thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owlsThe wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of restThere shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mateSeek ye out of the book of the LORD and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered themAnd he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell thereinThe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the roseIt shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of the LORD and the excellency of our GodStrengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble kneesSay to them that are of a fearful heart Be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even God with a recompence he will come and save youThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstoppedThen shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desertAnd the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushesAnd an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called The way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err thereinNo lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk thereAnd the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee awayNow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah and took themAnd the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers fieldThen came forth unto him Eliakim Hilkiahs son which was over the house and Shebna the scribe and Joah Asaphs son the recorderAnd Rabshakeh said unto them Say ye now to Hezekiah Thus saith the great king the king of Assyria What confidence is this wherein thou trustestI say sayest thou but they are but vain words I have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against meLo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on Egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in himBut if thou say to me We trust in the LORD our God is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away and said to Judah and to Jerusalem Ye shall worship before this altarNow therefore give pledges I pray thee to my master the king of Assyria and I will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon themHow then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemenAnd am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it the LORD said unto me Go up against this land and destroy itThen said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh Speak I pray thee unto thy servants in the Syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the Jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wallBut Rabshakeh said Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with youThen Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language and said Hear ye the words of the great king the king of AssyriaThus saith the king Let not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver youNeither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD saying The LORD will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of AssyriaHearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria Make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cisternUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyardsBeware lest Hezekiah persuade you saying The LORD will deliver us Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of AssyriaWhere are the gods of Hamath and Arphad where are the gods of Sepharvaim and have they delivered Samaria out of my handWho are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my handBut they held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying Answer him notThen came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah that was over the household and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of RabshakehAnd it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORDAnd he sent Eliakim who was over the household and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet the son of AmozAnd they said unto him Thus saith Hezekiah This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forthIt may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is leftSo the servants of king Hezekiah came to IsaiahAnd Isaiah said unto them Thus shall ye say unto your master Thus saith the LORD Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed meBehold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own landSo Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah for he had heard that he was departed from LachishAnd he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia He is come forth to make war with thee And when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah sayingThus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of AssyriaBehold thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be deliveredHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden which were in TelassarWhere is the king of Hamath and the king of Arphad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena and IvahAnd Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORDAnd Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD sayingO LORD of hosts God of Israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earthIncline thine ear O LORD and hear open thine eyes O LORD and see and hear all the words of Sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living GodOf a truth LORD the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countriesAnd have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed themNow therefore O LORD our God save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD even thou onlyThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah saying Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of AssyriaThis is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at theeWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the Holy One of IsraelBy thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord and hast said By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of Lebanon and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and I will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his CarmelI have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged placesHast thou not heard long ago how I have done it and of ancient times that I have formed it now have I brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heapsTherefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown upBut I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against meBecause thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will I put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camestAnd this shall be a sign unto thee Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereofAnd the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upwardFor out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount Zion the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do thisTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against itBy the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the LORDFor I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant Davids sakeThen the angel of the LORD went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpsesSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at NinevehAnd it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of Armenia and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his steadIn those days was Hezekiah sick unto death And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him and said unto him Thus saith the LORD Set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not liveThen Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the LORDAnd said Remember now O LORD I beseech thee how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight And Hezekiah wept soreThen came the word of the LORD to Isaiah sayingGo and say to Hezekiah Thus saith the LORD the God of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto thy days fifteen yearsAnd I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this cityAnd this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spokenBehold I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward So the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone downThe writing of Hezekiah king of Judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sicknessI said in the cutting off of my days I shall go to the gates of the grave I am deprived of the residue of my yearsI said I shall not see the LORD even the LORD in the land of the living I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the worldMine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherds tent I have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of meI reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of meLike a crane or a swallow so did I chatter I did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward O LORD I am oppressed undertake for meWhat shall I say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soulO Lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to liveBehold for peace I had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy backFor the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truthThe living the living he shall praise thee as I do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truthThe LORD was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORDFor Isaiah had said Let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recoverHezekiah also had said What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORDAt that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present to Hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recoveredAnd Hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah shewed them notThen came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah and said unto him What said these men and from whence came they unto thee And Hezekiah said They are come from a far country unto me even from BabylonThen said he What have they seen in thine house And Hezekiah answered All that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed themThen said Isaiah to Hezekiah Hear the word of the LORD of hostsBehold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to Babylon nothing shall be left saith the LORDAnd of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of BabylonThen said Hezekiah to Isaiah Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken He said moreover For there shall be peace and truth in my daysComfort ye comfort ye my people saith your GodSpeak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the LORDs hand double for all her sinsThe voice of him that crieth in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the LORD make straight in the desert a highway for our GodEvery valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plainAnd the glory of the LORD shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken itThe voice said Cry And he said What shall I cry All flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the fieldThe grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it surely the people is grassThe grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our God shall stand for everO Zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain O Jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of Judah Behold your GodBehold the Lord GOD will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before himHe shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with youngWho hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balanceWho hath directed the Spirit of the LORD or being his counseller hath taught himWith whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understandingBehold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thingAnd Lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offeringAll nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanityTo whom then will ye liken God or what likeness will ye compare unto himThe workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chainsHe that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be movedHave ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earthIt is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell inThat bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanityYea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubbleTo whom then will ye liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy OneLift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one failethWhy sayest thou O Jacob and speakest O Israel My way is hid from the LORD and my judgment is passed over from my GodHast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting God the LORD the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understandingHe giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strengthEven the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fallBut they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faintKeep silence before me O islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgmentWho raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bowHe pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feetWho hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning I the LORD the first and with the last I am heThe isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and cameThey helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother Be of good courageSo the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying It is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be movedBut thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the seed of Abraham my friendThou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee Thou art my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee awayFear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousnessBehold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perishThou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of noughtFor I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee Fear not I will help theeFear not thou worm Jacob and ye men of Israel I will help thee saith the LORD and thy redeemer the Holy One of IsraelBehold I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaffThou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD and shalt glory in the Holy One of IsraelWhen the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst I the LORD will hear them I the God of Israel will not forsake themI will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys I will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of waterI will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree I will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree togetherThat they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the LORD hath done this and the Holy One of Israel hath created itProduce your cause saith the LORD bring forth your strong reasons saith the King of JacobLet them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to comeShew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it togetherBehold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth youI have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clayWho hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say He is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your wordsThe first shall say to Zion Behold behold them and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidingsFor I beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counseller that when I asked of them could answer a wordBehold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusionBehold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the GentilesHe shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the streetA bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truthHe shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his lawThus saith God the LORD he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk thereinI the LORD have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the GentilesTo open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison houseI am the LORD that is my name and my glory will I not give to another neither my praise to graven imagesBehold the former things are come to pass and new things do I declare before they spring forth I tell you of themSing unto the LORD a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereofLet the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that Kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountainsLet them give glory unto the LORD and declare his praise in the islandsThe LORD shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemiesI have long time holden my peace I have been still and refrained myself now will I cry like a travailing woman I will destroy and devour at onceI will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and I will make the rivers islands and I will dry up the poolsAnd I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not I will lead them in paths that they have not known I will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight These things will I do unto them and not forsake themThey shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images Ye are our godsHear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may seeWho is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that I sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the LORDs servantSeeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth notThe LORD is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourableBut this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith RestoreWho among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to comeWho gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers did not the LORD he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his lawTherefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heartBut now thus saith the LORD that created thee O Jacob and he that formed thee O Israel Fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mineWhen thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon theeFor I am the LORD thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and Seba for theeSince thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy lifeFear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the westI will say to the north Give up and to the south Keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earthEven every one that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made himBring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have earsLet all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say It is truthYe are my witnesses saith the LORD and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after meI even I am the LORD and beside me there is no saviourI have declared and have saved and I have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the LORD that I am GodYea before the day was I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand I will work and who shall let itThus saith the LORD your redeemer the Holy One of Israel For your sake I have sent to Babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the Chaldeans whose cry is in the shipsI am the LORD your Holy One the creator of Israel your KingThus saith the LORD which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty watersWhich bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as towRemember ye not the former things neither consider the things of oldBehold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desertThe beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because I give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosenThis people have I formed for myself they shall shew forth my praiseBut thou hast not called upon me O Jacob but thou hast been weary of me O IsraelThou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices I have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incenseThou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquitiesI even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sinsPut me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justifiedThy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against meTherefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given Jacob to the curse and Israel to reproachesYet now hear O Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have chosenThus saith the LORD that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee Fear not O Jacob my servant and thou Jesurun whom I have chosenFor I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspringAnd they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water coursesOne shall say I am the LORDs and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD and surname himself by the name of IsraelThus saith the LORD the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no GodAnd who as I shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since I appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto themFear ye not neither be afraid have not I told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses Is there a God beside me yea there is no God I know not anyThey that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamedWho hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothingBehold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed togetherThe smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faintThe carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the houseHe heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish itThen shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down theretoHe burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith Aha I am warm I have seen the fireAnd the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith Deliver me for thou art my godThey have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understandAnd none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say I have burned part of it in the fire yea also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof I have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination shall I fall down to the stock of a treeHe feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say Is there not a lie in my right handRemember these O Jacob and Israel for thou art my servant I have formed thee thou art my servant O Israel thou shalt not be forgotten of meI have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for I have redeemed theeSing O ye heavens for the LORD hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains O forest and every tree therein for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob and glorified himself in IsraelThus saith the LORD thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the LORD that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myselfThat frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolishThat confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to Jerusalem Thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of Judah Ye shall be built and I will raise up the decayed places thereofThat saith to the deep Be dry and I will dry up thy riversThat saith of Cyrus He is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem Thou shalt be built and to the temple Thy foundation shall be laidThus saith the LORD to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shutI will go before thee and make the crooked places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of ironAnd I will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the LORD which call thee by thy name am the God of IsraelFor Jacob my servants sake and Israel mine elect I have even called thee by thy name I have surnamed thee though thou hast not known meI am the LORD and there is none else there is no God beside me I girded thee though thou hast not known meThat they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me I am the LORD and there is none elseI form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil I the LORD do all these thingsDrop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together I the LORD have created itWoe unto him that striveth with his Maker Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it What makest thou or thy work He hath no handsWoe unto him that saith unto his father What begettest thou or to the woman What hast thou brought forthThus saith the LORD the Holy One of Israel and his Maker Ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye meI have made the earth and created man upon it I even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have I commandedI have raised him up in righteousness and I will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the LORD of hostsThus saith the LORD The labour of Egypt and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying Surely God is in thee and there is none else there is no GodVerily thou art a God that hidest thyself O God of Israel the SaviourThey shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idolsBut Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without endFor thus saith the LORD that created the heavens God himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the LORD and there is none elseI have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth I said not unto the seed of Jacob Seek ye me in vain I the LORD

is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return That unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swearSurely shall one say in the LORD have I righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamedIn the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified and shall gloryBel boweth down Nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beastThey stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivityHearken unto me O house of Jacob and all the remnant of the house of Israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the wombAnd even to your old age I am he and even to hoar hairs will I carry you I have made and I will bear even I will carry and will deliver youTo whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be likeThey lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worshipThey bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his troubleRemember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind O ye transgressorsRemember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like meDeclaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying My counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasureCalling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea I have spoken it I will also bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do itHearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousnessI bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my gloryCome down and sit in the dust O virgin daughter of Babylon sit on the ground there is no throne O daughter of the Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicateTake the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the riversThy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen I will take vengeance and I will not meet thee as a manAs for our redeemer the LORD of hosts is his name the Holy One of IsraelSit thou silent and get thee into darkness O daughter of the Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdomsI was wroth with my people I have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yokeAnd thou saidst I shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of itTherefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart I am and none else beside me I shall not sit as a widow neither shall I know the loss of childrenBut these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantmentsFor thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said None seeth me Thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart I am and none else beside meTherefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not knowStand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevailThou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels Let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon theeBehold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before itThus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save theeHear ye this O house of Jacob which are called by the name of Israel and are come forth out of the waters of Judah which swear by the name of the LORD and make mention of the God of Israel but not in truth nor in righteousnessFor they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the God of Israel The LORD of hosts is his nameI have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and I shewed them I did them suddenly and they came to passBecause I knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brassI have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass I shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say Mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded themThou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it I have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know themThey are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say Behold I knew themYea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the wombFor my names sake will I defer mine anger and for my praise will I refrain for thee that I cut thee not offBehold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen thee in the furnace of afflictionFor mine own sake even for mine own sake will I do it for how should my name be polluted and I will not give my glory unto anotherHearken unto me O Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am the first I also am the lastMine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when I call unto them they stand up togetherAll ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things The LORD hath loved him he will do his pleasure on Babylon and his arm shall be on the ChaldeansI even I have spoken yea I have called him I have brought him and he shall make his way prosperousCome ye near unto me hear ye this I have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am I and now the Lord GOD and his Spirit hath sent meThus saith the LORD thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest goO that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the seaThy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before meGo ye forth of Babylon flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye The LORD hath redeemed his servant JacobAnd they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed outThere is no peace saith the LORD unto the wickedListen O isles unto me and hearken ye people from far The LORD hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my nameAnd he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid meAnd said unto me Thou art my servant O Israel in whom I will be glorifiedThen I said I have laboured in vain I have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the LORD and my work with my GodAnd now saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him Though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD and my God shall be my strengthAnd he said It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earthThus saith the LORD the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers Kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the LORD that is faithful and the Holy One of Israel and he shall choose theeThus saith the LORD In an acceptable time have I heard thee and in a day of salvation have I helped thee and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritagesThat thou mayest say to the prisoners Go forth to them that are in darkness Shew yourselves They shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high placesThey shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide themAnd I will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exaltedBehold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of SinimSing O heavens and be joyful O earth and break forth into singing O mountains for the LORD hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflictedBut Zion said The LORD hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten meCan a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will I not forget theeBehold I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before meThy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of theeLift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee As I live saith the LORD thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doethFor thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far awayThe children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears The place is too strait for me give place to me that I may dwellThen shalt thou say in thine heart Who hath begotten me these seeing I have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these Behold I was left alone these where had they beenThus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shouldersAnd kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that I am the LORD for they shall not be ashamed that wait for meShall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive deliveredBut thus saith the LORD Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee and I will save thy childrenAnd I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer the mighty One of JacobThus saith the LORD Where is the bill of your mothers divorcement whom I have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you Behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put awayWherfore when I came was there no man when I called was there none to answer Is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have I no power to deliver behold at my rebuke I dry up the sea I make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirstI clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their coveringThe Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learnedThe Lord GOD hath opened mine ear and I was not rebellious neither turned away backI gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hid not my face from shame and spittingFor the Lord GOD will help me therefore shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamedHe is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to meBehold the Lord GOD will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them upWho is among you that feareth the LORD that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the LORD and stay upon his GodBehold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled This shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrowHearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the LORD look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are diggedLook unto Abraham your father and unto Sarah that bare you for I called him alone and blessed him and increased himFor the LORD shall comfort Zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of the LORD joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melodyHearken unto me my people and give ear unto me O my nation for a law shall proceed from me and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the peopleMy righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine arm shall they trustLift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolishedHearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilingsFor the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generationAwake awake put on strength O arm of the LORD awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab and wounded the dragonArt thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass overTherefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return and come with singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee awayI even I am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grassAnd forgettest the LORD thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressorThe captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should failBut I am the LORD thy God that divided the sea whose waves roared The LORD of hosts is his nameAnd I have put my words in thy mouth and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto Zion Thou art my peopleAwake awake stand up O Jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them outThere is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought upThese two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall I comfort theeThy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the LORD the rebuke of thy GodTherefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wineThus saith thy Lord the LORD and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people Behold I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it againBut I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul Bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went overAwake awake put on thy strength O Zion put on thy beautiful garments O Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the uncleanShake thyself from the dust arise and sit down O Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck O captive daughter of ZionFor thus saith the LORD Ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without moneyFor thus saith the Lord GOD My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there and the Assyrian oppressed them without causeNow therefore what have I here saith the LORD that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the LORD and my name continually every day is blasphemedTherefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak behold it is IHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto Zion Thy God reignethThy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the LORD shall bring again ZionBreak forth into joy sing together ye waste places of Jerusalem for the LORD hath comforted his people he hath redeemed JerusalemThe LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our GodDepart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the LORDFor ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the LORD will go before you and the God of Israel will be your rerewardBehold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very highAs many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of menSo shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they considerWho hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealedFor he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire himHe is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him notSurely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflictedBut he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healedAll we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us allHe was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouthHe was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he strickenAnd he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouthYet it pleased the LORD to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his handHe shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquitiesTherefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressorsSing O barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the LORDEnlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakesFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabitedFear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any moreFor thy Maker is thine husband the LORD of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel The God of the whole earth shall he be calledFor the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy GodFor a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great mercies will I gather theeIn a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the LORD thy RedeemerFor this is as the waters of Noah unto me for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke theeFor the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the LORD that hath mercy on theeO thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold I will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphiresAnd I will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stonesAnd all thy children shall be taught of the LORD and great shall be the peace of thy childrenIn righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near theeBehold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sakeBehold I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroyNo weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their righteousness is of me saith the LORDHo every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without priceWherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatnessIncline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of DavidBehold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the peopleBehold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified theeSeek ye the LORD while he may be found call ye upon him while he is nearLet the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the LORD and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardonFor my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the LORDFor as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughtsFor as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eaterSo shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent itFor ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their handsInstead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the LORD for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut offThus saith the LORD Keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealedBlessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evilNeither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the LORD speak saying The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say Behold I am a dry treeFor thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenantEven unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut offAlso the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the LORD to serve him and to love the name of the LORD to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenantEven them will I bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all peopleThe Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith Yet will I gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto himAll ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forestHis watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumberYea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarterCome ye say they I will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundantThe righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to comeHe shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightnessBut draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whoreAgainst whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehoodEnflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocksAmong the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering Should I receive comfort in theseUpon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrificeBehind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest itAnd thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hellThou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not There is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grievedAnd of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not I held my peace even of old and thou fearest me notI will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit theeWhen thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountainAnd shall say Cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my peopleFor thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite onesFor I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which I have madeFor the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him I hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heartI have seen his ways and will heal him I will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mournersI create the fruit of the lips Peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the LORD and I will heal himBut the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirtThere is no peace saith my God to the wickedCry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sinsYet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to GodWherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge Behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your laboursBehold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on highIs it such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the LORDIs not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yokeIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own fleshThen shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the LORD shall be thy rerewardThen shalt thou call and the LORD shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanityAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noondayAnd the LORD shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail notAnd they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach The restorer of paths to dwell inIf thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the LORD honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own wordsThen shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken itBehold the LORDs hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hearBut your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hearFor your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perversenessNone calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquityThey hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viperTheir webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their handsTheir feet run to evil and they make hast to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their pathsThe way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peaceTherefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darknessWe grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noonday as in the night we are in desolate places as dead menWe roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from usFor our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know themIn transgressing and lying against the LORD and departing away from our God speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehoodAnd judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enterYea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the LORD saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgmentAnd he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained himFor he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a clokeAccording to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompenceSo shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun When the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against himAnd the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the LORDAs for me this is my covenant with them saith the LORD My spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the LORD from henceforth and for everArise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the LORD is risen upon theeFor behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the LORD shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon theeAnd the Gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy risingLift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy sideThen thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto theeThe multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah all they from Sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORDAll the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and I will glorify the house of my gloryWho are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windowsSurely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of Tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the LORD thy God and to the Holy One of Israel because he hath glorified theeAnd the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath I smote thee but in my favour have I had mercy on theeTherefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles and that their kings may be broughtFor the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wastedThe glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and I will make the place of my feet gloriousThe sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee The city of the LORD The Zion of the Holy One of IsraelWhereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee I will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generationsThou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer the mighty One of JacobFor brass I will bring gold and for iron I will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron I will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousnessViolence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation and thy gates PraiseThe sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy God thy gloryThy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be endedThy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that I may be glorifiedA little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation I the LORD will hasten it in his timeThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are boundTo proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mournTo appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the LORD that he might be glorifiedAnd they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generationsAnd strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressersBut ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD men shall call you the Ministers of our God ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourselvesFor your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto themFor I the LORD love judgment I hate robbery for burnt offering and I will direct their work in truth and I will make an everlasting covenant with themAnd their seed shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessedI will greatly rejoice in the LORD my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewelsFor as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nationsFor Zions sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalems sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burnethAnd the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the LORD shall nameThou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD and a royal diadem in the hand of thy GodThou shalt no more be termed Forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah and thy land Beulah for the LORD delighteth in thee and thy land shall be marriedFor as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over theeI have set watchmen upon thy walls O Jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the LORD keep not silenceAnd give him no rest till he establish and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earthThe LORD hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast labouredBut they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the LORD and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holinessGo through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the peopleBehold the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world Say ye to the daughter of Zion Behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before himAnd they shall call them The holy people The redeemed of the LORD and thou shalt be called Sought out A city not forsakenWho is this that cometh from Edom with dyed garments from Bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength I that speak in righteousness mighty to saveWherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefatI have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for I will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and I will stain all my raimentFor the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is comeAnd I looked and there was none to help and I wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld meAnd I will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and I will bring down their strength to the earthI will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD and the praises of the LORD according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnessesFor he said Surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their SaviourIn all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of oldBut they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against themThen he remembered the days of old Moses and his people saying Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy Spirit within himThat led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting nameThat led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumbleAs a beast goeth down into the valley the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious nameLook down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they restrainedDoubtless thou art our father though Abraham be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledge us not thou O LORD art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlastingO LORD why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear Return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritanceThe people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuaryWe are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy nameOh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presenceAs when the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presenceWhen thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presenceFor since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen O God beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for himThou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be savedBut we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us awayAnd there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquitiesBut now O LORD thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy handBe not wroth very sore O LORD neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy peopleThy holy cities are a wilderness Zion is a wilderness Jerusalem a desolationOur holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid wasteWilt thou refrain thyself for these things O LORD wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very soreI am sought of them that asked not for me I am found of them that sought me not I said Behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my nameI have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughtsA people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brickWhich remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vesselsWhich say Stand by thyself come not near to me for I am holier than thou These are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the dayBehold it is written before me I will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosomYour iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the LORD which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will I measure their former work into their bosomThus saith the LORD As the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith Destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will I do for my servants sakes that I may not destroy them allAnd I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell thereAnd Sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought meBut ye are they that forsake the LORD that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that numberTherefore will I number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when I called ye did not answer when I spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein I delighted notTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamedBehold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spiritAnd ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the Lord GOD shall slay thee and call his servants by another nameThat he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyesFor behold I create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mindBut be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joyAnd I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of cryingThere shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursedAnd they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of themThey shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their handsThey shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD and their offspring with themAnd it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hearThe wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the LORDThus saith the LORD The heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my restFor all those things hath mine hand made and those things have been saith the LORD but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my wordHe that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol Yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominationsI also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when I called none did answer when I spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which I delighted notHear the word of the LORD ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake said Let the LORD be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamedA voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemiesBefore she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man childWho hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her childrenShall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the LORD shall I cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy GodRejoice ye with Jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for herThat ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her gloryFor thus saith the LORD Behold I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her kneesAs one whom his mother comforteth so will I comfort you and ye shall be comforted in JerusalemAnd when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemiesFor behold the LORD will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fireFor by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh and the slain of the LORD shall be manyThey that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the LORDFor I know their works and their thoughts it shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my gloryAnd I will set a sign among them and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations to Tarshish Pul and Lud that draw the bow to Tubal and Javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the GentilesAnd they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain Jerusalem saith the LORD as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORDAnd I will also take of them for priests and for Levites saith the LORDFor as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me saith the LORD so shall your seed and your name remainAnd it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the LORDAnd they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all fleshThe words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of BenjaminTo whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah in the thirteenth year of his reignIt came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth monthThen the word of the LORD came unto me sayingBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nationsThen said I Ah Lord GOD behold I cannot speak for I am a childBut the LORD said unto me Say not I am a child for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speakBe not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the LORDThen the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth And the LORD said unto me Behold I have put my words in thy mouthSee I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plantMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou And I said I see a rod of an almond treeThen said the LORD unto me Thou hast well seen for I will hasten my word to perform itAnd the word of the LORD came unto me the second time saying What seest thou And I said I see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the northThen the LORD said unto me Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the landFor lo I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the LORD and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of JudahAnd I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own handsThou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest I confound thee before themFor behold I have made thee this day a defenced city and an iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the kings of Judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the landAnd they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for I am with thee saith the LORD to deliver theeMoreover the word of the LORD came to me sayingGo and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying Thus saith the LORD I remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sownIsrael was holiness unto the LORD and the firstfruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them saith the LORDHear ye the word of the LORD O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of IsraelThus saith the LORD What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vainNeither said they Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dweltAnd I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made mine heritage an abominationThe priests said not Where is the LORD and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after things that do not profitWherefore I will yet plead with you saith the LORD and with your childrens children will I pleadFor pass over the isles of Chittim and see and send unto Kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thingHath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profitBe astonished O ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith the LORDFor my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no waterIs Israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiledThe young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his land waste his cities are burned without inhabitantAlso the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy headHast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God when he led thee by the wayAnd now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt to drink the waters of Sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria to drink the waters of the riverThine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God and that my fear is not in thee saith the Lord GOD of hostsFor of old time I have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and thou saidst I will not transgress when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlotYet I had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto meFor though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the Lord GODHow canst thou say I am not polluted I have not gone after Baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art a swift dromedary traversing her waysA wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find herWithhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst There is no hope no for I have loved strangers and after them will I goAs the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of Israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophetsSaying to a stock Thou art my father and to a stone Thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say Arise and save usBut where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods O JudahWherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against me saith the LORDIn vain have I smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lionO generation see ye the word of the LORD Have I been a wilderness unto Israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people We are lords we will come no more unto theeCan a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without numberWhy trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy waysAlso in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents I have not found it by secret search but upon all theseYet thou sayest Because I am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me Behold I will plead with thee because thou sayest I have not sinnedWhy gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wast ashamed of AssyriaYea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine head for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not prosper in themThey say If a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the LORDLift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hast not been lien with In the ways hast thou sat for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickednessTherefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou hadst a whores forehead thou refusedst to be ashamedWilt thou not from this time cry unto me My father thou art the guide of my youthWill he reserve his anger for ever will he keep it to the end Behold thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldestThe LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlotAnd I said after she had done all these things Turn thou unto me But she returned not And her treacherous sister Judah saw itAnd I saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the harlot alsoAnd it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocksAnd yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the LORDAnd the LORD said unto me The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous JudahGo and proclaim these words toward the north and say Return thou backsliding Israel saith the LORD and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you for I am merciful saith the LORD and I will not keep anger for everOnly acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the LORDTurn O backsliding children saith the LORD for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring you to ZionAnd I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understandingAnd it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the LORD they shall say no more The ark of the covenant of the LORD neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done any moreAt that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the LORD to Jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heartIn those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathersBut I said How shall I put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and I said Thou shalt call me My father and shalt not turn away from meSurely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me O house of Israel saith the LORDA voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplications of the children of Israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the LORD their GodReturn ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings Behold we come unto thee for thou art the LORD our GodTruly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the multitude of mountains truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of IsraelFor shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughtersWe lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for we have sinned against the LORD our God we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our GodIf thou wilt return O Israel saith the LORD return unto me and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not removeAnd thou shalt swear The LORD liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they gloryFor thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem Break up your fallow ground and sow not among thornsCircumcise yourselves to the LORD and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doingsDeclare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say Blow ye the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say Assemble yourselves and let us go into the defenced citiesSet up the standard toward Zion retire stay not for I will bring evil from the north and a great destructionThe lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitantFor this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from usAnd it shall come to pass at that day saith the LORD that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonderThen said I Ah Lord GOD surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem saying Ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soulAt that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanseEven a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will I give sentence against themBehold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles Woe unto us for we are spoiledO Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within theeFor a voice declareth from Dan and publisheth affliction from mount EphraimMake ye mention to the nations behold publish against Jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of JudahAs keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith the LORDThy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto thine heartMy bowels my bowels I am pained at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me I cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard O my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of warDestruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a momentHow long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpetFor my people is foolish they have not known me they are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledgeI beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no lightI beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightlyI beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fledI beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD and by his fierce angerFor thus hath the LORD said The whole land shall be desolate yet will I not make a full endFor this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because I have spoken it I have purposed it and will not repent neither will I turn back from itThe whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell thereinAnd when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do Though thou clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy lifeFor I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of Zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her hands saying Woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of murderersRun ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and I will pardon itAnd though they say The LORD liveth surely they swear falselyO LORD are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to returnTherefore I said Surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the LORD nor the judgment of their GodI will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the LORD and the judgment of their God but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bondsWherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increasedHow shall I pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when I had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots housesThey were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbours wifeShall I not visit for these things saith the LORD and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as thisGo ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her battlements for they are not the LORDsFor the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the LORDThey have belied the LORD and said It is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famineAnd the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto themWherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts Because ye speak this word behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour themLo I will bring a nation upon you from far O house of Israel saith the LORD it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they sayTheir quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty menAnd they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the swordNevertheless in those days saith the LORD I will not make a full end with youAnd it shall come to pass when ye shall say Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them Like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yoursDeclare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah sayingHear now this O foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear notFear ye not me saith the LORD will ye not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over itBut this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and goneNeither say they in their heart Let us now fear the LORD our God that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvestYour iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good things from youFor among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he that setteth snares they set a trap they catch menAs a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen richThey are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judgeShall I not visit for these things saith the LORD shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as thisA wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the landThe prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereofO ye children of Benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem and blow the trumpet in Tekoa and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great destructionI have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate womanThe shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one in his placePrepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon Woe unto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are stretched outArise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palacesFor thus hath the LORD of hosts said Hew ye down trees and cast a mount against Jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of herAs a fountain casteth out her waters so she casteth out her wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually is grief and woundsBe thou instructed O Jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee lest I make thee desolate a land not inhabitedThus saith the LORD of hosts They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the basketsTo whom shall I speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach they have no delight in itTherefore I am full of the fury of the LORD I am weary with holding in I will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of daysAnd their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields and wives together for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith the LORDFor from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falselyThey have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying Peace peace when there is no peaceWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down saith the LORDThus saith the LORD Stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls But they said We will not walk thereinAlso I set watchmen over you saying Hearken to the sound of the trumpet But they said We will not hearkenTherefore hear ye nations and know O congregation what is among themHear O earth behold I will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words nor to my law but rejected itTo what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto meTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perishThus saith the LORD Behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earthThey shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee O daughter of ZionWe have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travailGo not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every sideO daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon usI have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their wayThey are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are brass and iron they are all corruptersThe bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked awayReprobate silver shall men call them because the LORD hath rejected themThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD sayingStand in the gate of the LORDs house and proclaim there this word and say Hear the word of the LORD all ye of Judah that enter in at these gates to worship the LORDThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Amend your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this placeTrust ye not in lying words saying The temple of the LORD The temple of the LORD The temple of the LORD are theseFor if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbourIf ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurtThen will I cause you to dwell in this place in the land that I gave to your fathers for ever and everBehold ye trust in lying words that cannot profitWill ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto Baal and walk after other gods whom ye know notAnd come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say We are delivered to do all these abominationsIs this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes Behold even I have seen it saith the LORDBut go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh where I set my name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people IsraelAnd now because ye have done all these works saith the LORD and I spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and I called you but ye answered notTherefore will I do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers as I have done to ShilohAnd I will cast you out of my sight as I have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of EphraimTherefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for I will not hear theeSeest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of JerusalemThe children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to angerDo they provoke me to anger saith the LORD do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own facesTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenchedThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat fleshFor I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrificesBut this thing commanded I them saying Obey my voice and I will be your God and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto youBut they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forwardSince the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending themYet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathersTherefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer theeBut thou shalt say unto them This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouthCut off thine hair O Jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrathFor the children of Judah have done evil in my sight saith the LORD they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute itAnd they have built the high places of Tophet which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which I commanded them not neither came it into my heartTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that it shall no more be called Tophet nor the valley of the son of Hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in Tophet till there be no placeAnd the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them awayThen will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolateAt that time saith the LORD they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their gravesAnd they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earthAnd death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither I have driven them saith the LORD of hostsMoreover thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD Shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not returnWhy then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to returnI hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented him of his wickedness saying What have I done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battleYea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the LORDHow do ye say We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us Lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vainThe wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the LORD and what wisdom is in themTherefore will I give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falselyFor they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying Peace peace when there is no peaceWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the LORDI will surely consume them saith the LORD there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade and the things that I have given them shall pass away from themWhy do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the LORD our God hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the LORDWe looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold troubleThe snorting of his horses was heard from Dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell thereinFor behold I will send serpents cockatrices among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the LORDWhen I would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in meBehold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country Is not the LORD in Zion is not her king in her Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanitiesThe harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not savedFor the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonishment hath taken hold on meIs there no balm in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recoveredOh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my peopleOh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that I might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous menAnd they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the LORDTake ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour will walk with slandersAnd they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquityThine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the LORDTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will melt them and try them for how shall I do for the daughter of my peopleTheir tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his waitShall I not visit them for these things saith the LORD shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as thisFor the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are goneAnd I will make Jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and I will make the cities of Judah desolate without an inhabitantWho is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none passeth throughAnd the LORD saith Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked thereinBut have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after Baalim which their fathers taught themTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drinkI will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their fathers have known and I will send a sword after them till I have consumed themThus saith the LORD of hosts Consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may comeAnd let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with watersFor a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion How are we spoiled we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us outYet hear the word of the LORD O ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentationFor death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streetsSpeak Thus saith the LORD Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather themThus saith the LORD Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his richesBut let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things I delight saith the LORDBehold the days come saith the LORD that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcisedEgypt and Judah and Edom and the children of Ammon and Moab and all that are in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heartHear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you O house of IsraelThus saith the LORD Learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at themFor the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axeThey deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move notThey are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go Be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do goodForasmuch as there is none like unto thee O LORD thou art great and thy name is great in mightWho would not fear thee O King of nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto theeBut they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a doctrine of vanitiesSilver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning menBut the LORD is the true God he is the living God and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignationThus shall ye say unto them The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavensHe hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretionWhen he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuresEvery man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in themThey are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perishThe portion of Jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and Israel is the rod of his inheritance The LORD of hosts is his nameGather up thy wares out of the land O inhabitant of the fortressFor thus saith the LORD Behold I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that they may find it soWoe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but I said Truly this is a grief and I must bear itMy tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtainsFor the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the LORD therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scatteredBehold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of Judah desolate and a den of dragonsO LORD I know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his stepsO LORD correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothingPour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up Jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation desolateThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD sayingHear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of JerusalemAnd say thou unto them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenantWhich I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace saying Obey my voice and do them according to all which I command you so shall ye be my people and I will be your GodThat I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day Then answered I and said So be it O LORDThen the LORD said unto me Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem saying Hear ye the words of this covenant and do themFor I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying Obey my voiceYet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which I commanded them to do but they did them notAnd the LORD said unto me A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of JerusalemThey are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to serve them the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathersTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me I will not hearken unto themThen shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their troubleFor according to the number of thy cities were thy gods O Judah and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto BaalTherefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their troubleWhat hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicestThe LORD called thy name A green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are brokenFor the LORD of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto BaalAnd the LORD hath given me knowledge of it and I know it then thou shewedst me their doingsBut I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter and I knew not that they had devised devices against me saying Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more rememberedBut O LORD of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have I revealed my causeTherefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth that seek thy life saying Prophesy not in the name of the LORD that thou die not by our handTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famineAnd there shall be no remnant of them for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth even the year of their visitationRighteous art thou O LORD when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouslyThou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reinsBut thou O LORD knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughterHow long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said He shall not see our last endIf thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of JordanFor even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto theeI have forsaken mine house I have left mine heritage I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemiesMine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out against me therefore have I hated itMine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field come to devourMany pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wildernessThey have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heartThe spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peaceThey have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORDThus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit Behold I will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of Judah from among themAnd it shall come to pass after that I have plucked them out I will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his landAnd it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name The LORD liveth as they taught my people to swear by Baal then shall they be built in the midst of my peopleBut if they will not obey I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the LORDThus saith the LORD unto me Go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in waterSo I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD and put it on my loinsAnd the word of the LORD came unto me the second time sayingTake the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and arise go to Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rockSo I went and hid it by Euphrates as the LORD commanded meAnd it came to pass after many days that the LORD said unto me Arise go to Euphrates and take the girdle from thence which I commanded thee to hide thereThen I went to Euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothingThen the word of the LORD came unto me sayingThus saith the LORD After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of JerusalemThis evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothingFor as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah saith the LORD that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hearTherefore thou shalt speak unto them this word Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wineThen shalt thou say unto them Thus saith the LORD Behold I will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon Davids throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkennessAnd I will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the LORD I will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy themHear ye and give ear be not proud for the LORD hath spokenGive glory to the LORD your God before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darknessBut if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the LORDs flock is carried away captiveSay unto the king and to the queen Humble yourselves sit down for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your gloryThe cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open them Judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be wholly carried away captiveLift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flockWhat wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travailAnd if thou say in thine heart Wherefore come these things upon me For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bareCan the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evilTherefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wildernessThis is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the LORD because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehoodTherefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appearI have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields Woe unto thee O Jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once beThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearthJudah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black unto the ground and the cry of Jerusalem is gone upAnd their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their headsBecause the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their headsYea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because there was no grassAnd the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no grassO LORD though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for thy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against theeO the hope of Israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a nightWhy shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou O LORD art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us notThus saith the LORD unto this people Thus have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the LORD doth not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sinsThen said the LORD unto me Pray not for this people for their goodWhen they fast I will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation I will not accept them but I will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilenceThen said I Ah Lord GOD behold the prophets say unto them Ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but I will give you assured peace in this placeThen the LORD said unto me The prophets prophesy lies in my name I sent them not neither have I commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heartTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and I sent them not yet they say Sword and famine shall not be in this land By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumedAnd the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for I will pour their wickedness upon themTherefore thou shalt say this word unto them Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blowIf I go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if I enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know notHast thou utterly rejected Judah hath thy soul lothed Zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold troubleWe acknowledge O LORD our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against theeDo not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with usAre there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he O LORD our God therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these thingsThen said the LORD unto me Though Moses and Samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forthAnd it shall come to pass if they say unto thee Whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them Thus saith the LORD Such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the captivity to the captivityAnd I will appoint over them four kinds saith the LORD the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroyAnd I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah for that which he did in JerusalemFor who shall have pity upon thee O Jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doestThou hast forsaken me saith the LORD thou art gone backward therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee I am weary with repentingAnd I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land I will bereave them of children I will destroy my people since they return not from their waysTheir widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors upon the cityShe that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the LORDWoe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth I have neither lent on usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth curse meThe LORD said Verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of afflictionShall iron break the northern iron and the steelThy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy bordersAnd I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon youO LORD thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake I have suffered rebukeThy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for I am called by thy name O LORD God of hostsI sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced I sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignationWhy is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that failTherefore thus saith the LORD If thou return then will I bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but return not thou unto themAnd I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the LORDAnd I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terribleThe word of the LORD came also unto me sayingThou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this placeFor thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this landThey shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earthFor thus saith the LORD Enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament nor bemoan them for I have taken away my peace from this people saith the LORD even lovingkindness and merciesBoth the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for themNeither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their motherThou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drinkFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the brideAnd it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all these words and they shall say unto thee Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our GodThen shalt thou say unto them Because your fathers have forsaken me saith the LORD and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my lawAnd ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto meTherefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where I will not shew you favourTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that it shall no more be said The LORD liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of EgyptBut The LORD liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathersBehold I will send for many fishers saith the LORD and they shall fish them and after will I send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocksFor mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyesAnd first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable thingsO LORD my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say Surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no profitShall a man make gods unto himself and they are no godsTherefore behold I will this once cause them to know I will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is The LORDThe sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of your altarsWhilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hillsO my mountain in the field I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all thy bordersAnd thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for everThus saith the LORD Cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the LORDFor he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabitedBlessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD and whose hope the LORD isFor he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruitThe heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know itI the LORD search the heart I try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doingsAs the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and at his end shall be a foolA glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuaryO LORD the hope of Israel all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the LORD the fountain of living watersHeal me O LORD and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praiseBehold they say unto me Where is the word of the LORD let it come nowAs for me I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee neither have I desired the woeful day thou knowest that which came out of my lips was right before theeBe not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evilLet them be confounded that persecute me but let not me be confounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destructionThus said the LORD unto me Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of Judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gates of JerusalemAnd say unto them Hear ye the word of the LORD ye kings of Judah and all Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem that enter in by these gatesThus saith the LORD Take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of JerusalemNeither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as I commanded your fathersBut they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instructionAnd it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the LORD to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work thereinThen shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and this city shall remain for everAnd they shall come from the cities of Judah and from the places about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the plain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the LORDBut if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenchedThe word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD sayingArise and go down to the potters house and there I will cause thee to hear my wordsThen I went down to the potters house and behold he wrought a work on the wheelsAnd the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make itThen the word of the LORD came to me sayingO house of Israel cannot I do with you as this potter saith the LORD Behold as the clay is in the potters hand so are ye in mine hand O house of IsraelAt what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy itIf that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto themAnd at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant itIf it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit themNow therefore go to speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying Thus saith the LORD Behold I frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings goodAnd they said There is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heartTherefore thus saith the LORD Ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thingWill a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsakenBecause my people hath forgotten me they have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast upTo make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his headI will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy I will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamityThen said they Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet Come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his wordsGive heed to me O LORD and hearken to the voice of them that contend with meShall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from themTherefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battleLet a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feetYet LORD thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine angerThus saith the LORD Go and get a potters earthen bottle and take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priestsAnd go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom which is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that I shall tell theeAnd say Hear ye the word of the LORD O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingleBecause they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocentsThey have built also the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal which I commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mindTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that this place shall no more be called Tophet nor The valley of the son of Hinnom but The valley of slaughterAnd I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earthAnd I will make this city desolate and an hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereofAnd I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten themThen shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with theeAnd shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts Even so will I break this people and this city as one breaketh a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them in Tophet till there be no place to buryThus will I do unto this place saith the LORD and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as TophetAnd the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled as the place of Tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other godsThen came Jeremiah from Tophet whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the LORDs house and said to all the peopleThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my wordsNow Pashur the son of Immer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD heard that Jeremiah prophesied these thingsThen Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin which was by the house of the LORDAnd it came to pass on the morrow that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks Then said Jeremiah unto him The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur but Magor-missabibFor thus saith the LORD Behold I will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall carry them captive into Babylon and shall slay them with the swordMoreover I will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to BabylonAnd thou Pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to Babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied liesO LORD thou hast deceived me and I was deceived thou art stronger than I and hast prevailed I am in derision daily every one mocketh meFor since I spake I cried out I cried violence and spoil because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me and a derision dailyThen I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stayFor I heard the defaming of many fear on every side Report say they and we will report it All my familiars watched for my halting saying Peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on himBut the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgottenBut O LORD of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have I opened my causeSing unto the LORD praise ye the LORD for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoersCursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessedCursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying A man child is born unto thee making him very gladAnd let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontideBecause he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with meWherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shameThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest sayingInquire I pray thee of the LORD for us for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from usThen said Jeremiah unto them Thus shall ye say to ZedekiahThus saith the LORD God of Israel Behold I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and I will assemble them into the midst of this cityAnd I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrathAnd I will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilenceAnd afterward saith the LORD I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercyAnd unto this people thou shalt say Thus saith the LORD Behold I set before you the way of life and the way of deathHe that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a preyFor I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the LORD it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fireAnd touching the house of the king of Judah say Hear ye the word of the LORDO house of David thus saith the LORD Execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doingsBehold I am against thee O inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the LORD which say Who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitationsBut I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the LORD and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about itThus saith the LORD Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this wordAnd say Hear the word of the LORD O king of Judah that sittest upon the throne of David thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gatesThus saith the LORD Execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this placeFor if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his peopleBut if ye will not hear these words I swear by myself saith the LORD that this house shall become a desolationFor thus saith the LORD unto the kings house of Judah Thou art Gilead unto me and the head of Lebanon yet surely I will make thee a wilderness and cities which are not inhabitedAnd I will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fireAnd many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great cityThen they shall answer Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshipped other gods and served themWeep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native countryFor thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah which reigned instead of Josiah his father which went forth out of this place He shall not return thither any moreBut he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no moreWoe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wages and giveth him not for his workThat saith I will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilionShalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with himHe judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me saith the LORDBut thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do itTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah They shall not lament for him saying Ah my brother or Ah sister they shall not lament for him saying Ah lord or Ah his gloryHe shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of JerusalemGo up to Lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in Bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyedI spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst I will not hear This hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voiceThe wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickednessO inhabitant of Lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travailAs I live saith the LORD though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would I pluck thee thenceAnd I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the ChaldeansAnd I will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye dieBut to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not returnIs this man Coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know notO earth earth earth hear the word of the LORDThus saith the LORD Write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in JudahWoe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the LORDTherefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people Ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the LORDAnd I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increaseAnd I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the LORDBehold the days come saith the LORD that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch and a King shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earthIn his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESSTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that they shall no more say The LORD liveth which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of EgyptBut The LORD liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country and from all countries whither I had driven them and they shall dwell in their own landMine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake I am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the LORD and because of the words of his holinessFor the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not rightFor both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have I found their wickedness saith the LORDWherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for I will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the LORDAnd I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria they prophesied in Baal and caused my people Israel to errI have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them unto me as Sodom and the inhabitants thereof as GomorrahTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets Behold I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the landThus saith the LORD of hosts Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the LORDThey say still unto them that despise me The LORD hath said Ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart No evil shall come upon youFor who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD and hath perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard itBehold a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury even a grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wickedThe anger of the LORD shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectlyI have not sent these prophets yet they ran I have not spoken to them yet they prophesiedBut if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doingsAm I a God at hand saith the LORD and not a God afar offCan any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him saith the LORD Do not I fill heaven and earth saith the LORDI have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my name saying I have dreamed I have dreamedHow long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own heartWhich think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have forgotten my name for BaalThe prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully What is the chaff to the wheat saith the LORDIs not my word like as a fire saith the LORD and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in piecesTherefore behold I am against the prophets saith the LORD that steal my words every one from his neighbourBehold I am against the prophets saith the LORD that use their tongues and say He saithBehold I am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the LORD and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet I sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the LORDAnd when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying What is the burden of the LORD thou shalt then say unto them What burden I will even forsake you saith the LORDAnd as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say The burden of the LORD I will even punish that man and his houseThus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother What hath the LORD answered and What hath the LORD spokenAnd the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more for every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living God of the LORD of hosts our GodThus shalt thou say to the prophet What hath the LORD answered thee and What hath the LORD spokenBut since ye say The burden of the LORD therefore thus saith the LORD Because ye say this word The burden of the LORD and I have sent unto you saying Ye shall not say The burden of the LORDTherefore behold I even I will utterly forget you and I will forsake you and the city that I gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presenceAnd I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgottenThe LORD shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the princes of Judah with the carpenters and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to BabylonOne basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be eaten they were so badThen said the LORD unto me What seest thou Jeremiah And I said Figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evilAgain the word of the LORD came unto me sayingThus saith the LORD the God of Israel Like these good figs so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their goodFor I will set mine eyes upon them for good and I will bring them again to this land and I will build them and not pull them down and I will plant them and not pluck them upAnd I will give them an heart to know me that I am the LORD and they shall be my people and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heartAnd as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus saith the LORD So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of EgyptAnd I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither I shall drive themAnd I will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathersThe word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of BabylonThe which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem sayingFrom the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah even unto this day that is the three and twentieth year the word of the LORD hath come unto me and I have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkenedAnd the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hearThey said Turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and everAnd go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and I will do you no hurtYet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the LORD that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurtTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts Because ye have not heard my wordsBehold I will send and take all the families of the north saith the LORD and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolationsMoreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the candleAnd this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy yearsAnd it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation saith the LORD for their iniquity and the land of the Chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolationsAnd I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nationsFor many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own handsFor thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink itAnd they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword that I will send among themThen took I the cup at the LORDs hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the LORD had sent meTo wit Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse as it is this dayPharaoh king of Egypt and his servants and his princes and all his peopleAnd all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines and Ashkelon and Azzah and Ekron and the remnant of AshdodEdom and Moab and the children of AmmonAnd all the kings of Tyrus and all the kings of Zidon and the kings of the isles which are beyond the seaDedan and Tema and Buz and all that are in the utmost cornersAnd all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desertAnd all the kings of Zimri and all the kings of Elam and all the kings of the MedesAnd all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of Sheshach shall drink after themTherefore thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Drink ye and be drunken and spue and fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among youAnd it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts Ye shall certainly drinkFor lo I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished Ye shall not be unpunished for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the LORD of hostsTherefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them The LORD shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earthA noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the LORDThus saith the LORD of hosts Behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earthAnd the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the groundHowl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant vesselAnd the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escapeA voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard for the LORD hath spoiled their pastureAnd the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORDHe hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce angerIn the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD sayingThus saith the LORD Stand in the court of the LORDs house and speak unto all the cities of Judah which come to worship in the LORDs house all the words that I command thee to speak unto them diminish not a wordIf so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doingsAnd thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD If ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which I have set before youTo hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkenedThen will I make this house like Shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earthSo the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORDNow it came to pass when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying Thou shalt surely dieWhy hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD saying This house shall be like Shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORDWhen the princes of Judah heard these things then they came up from the kings house unto the house of the LORD and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORDs houseThen spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying This man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your earsThen spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heardTherefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the LORD your God and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against youAs for me behold I am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto youBut know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your earsThen said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets This man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our GodThen rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people sayingMicah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and spake to all the people of Judah saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts Zion shall be plowed like a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountains of the house as the high places of a forestDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death did he not fear the LORD and besought the LORD and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them Thus might we procure great evil against our soulsAnd there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of JeremiahAnd when Jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when Urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into EgyptAnd Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt namely Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into EgyptAnd they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common peopleNevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to deathIn the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD sayingThus saith the LORD to me Make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neckAnd send them to the king of Edom and to the king of Moab and to the king of the Ammonites and to the king of Tyrus and to the king of Zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of JudahAnd command them to say unto their masters Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Thus shall ye say unto your mastersI have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto meAnd now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve himAnd all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of himAnd it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon that nation will I punish saith the LORD with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until I have consumed them by his handTherefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying Ye shall not serve the king of BabylonFor they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that I should drive you out and ye should perishBut the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him those will I let remain still in their own land saith the LORD and they shall till it and dwell thereinI spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words saying Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and liveWhy will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of BabylonTherefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto youFor I have not sent them saith the LORD yet they prophesy a lie in my name that I might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto youAlso I spake to the priests and to all this people saying Thus saith the LORD Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying Behold the vessels of the LORDs house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto youHearken not unto them serve the king of Babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid wasteBut if they be prophets and if the word of the LORD be with them let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem go not to BabylonFor thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this cityWhich Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon and all the nobles of Judah and JerusalemYea thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and of JerusalemThey shall be carried to Babylon and there shall they be until the day that I visit them saith the LORD then will I bring them up and restore them to this placeAnd it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet which was of Gibeon spake unto me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and of all the people sayingThus speaketh the LORD of hosts the God of Israel saying I have broken the yoke of the king of BabylonWithin two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORDs house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to BabylonAnd I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah with all the captives of Judah that went into Babylon saith the LORD for I will break the yoke of the king of BabylonThen the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORDEven the prophet Jeremiah said Amen the LORD do so the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the LORDs house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this placeNevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the peopleThe prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilenceThe prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the LORD hath truly sent himThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiahs neck and brake itAnd Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying Thus saith the LORD Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years And the prophet Jeremiah went his wayThen the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah sayingGo and tell Hananiah saying Thus saith the LORD Thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of ironFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and they shall serve him and I have given him the beasts of the field alsoThen said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet Hear now Hananiah The LORD hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lieTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORDSo Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh monthNow these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to BabylonAfter that Jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of Judah and Jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from JerusalemBy the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel unto all that are carried away captives whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto BabylonBuild ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of themTake ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminishedAnd seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the LORD for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peaceFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamedFor they prophesy falsely unto you in my name I have not sent them saith the LORDFor thus saith the LORD That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this placeFor I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the LORD thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected endThen shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto youAnd ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heartAnd I will be found of you saith the LORD and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither I have driven you saith the LORD and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captiveBecause ye have said The LORD hath raised us up prophets in BabylonKnow that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivityThus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evilAnd I will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither I have driven themBecause they have not hearkened to my words saith the LORD which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the LORDHear ye therefore the word of the LORD all ye of the captivity whom I have sent from Jerusalem to BabylonThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel of Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name Behold I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall slay them before your eyesAnd of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon saying The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fireBecause they have committed villany in Israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which I have not commanded them even I know and am a witness saith the LORDThus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite sayingThus speaketh the LORD of hosts the God of Israel saying Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest and to all the priests sayingThe LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocksNow therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth which maketh himself a prophet to youFor therefore he sent unto us in Babylon saying This captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of themAnd Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophetThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah sayingSend to all them of the captivity saying Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and I sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lieTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people saith the LORD because he hath taught rebellion against the LORDThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD sayingThus speaketh the LORD God of Israel saying Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a bookFor lo the days come saith the LORD that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah saith the LORD and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers and they shall possess itAnd these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning JudahFor thus saith the LORD We have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peaceAsk ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into palenessAlas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of Jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of itFor it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD of hosts that I will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of himBut they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king whom I will raise up unto themTherefore fear thou not O my servant Jacob saith the LORD neither be dismayed O Israel for lo I will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraidFor I am with thee saith the LORD to save thee though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee yet will I not make a full end of thee but I will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunishedFor thus saith the LORD Thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is grievousThere is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicinesAll thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increasedWhy criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased I have done these things unto theeTherefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will I give for a preyFor I will restore health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds saith the LORD because they called thee an Outcast saying This is Zion whom no man seeketh afterThus saith the LORD Behold I will bring again the captivity of Jacobs tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner thereofAnd out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and I will multiply them and they shall not be few I will also glorify them and they shall not be smallTheir children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and I will punish all that oppress themAnd their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and I will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the LORDAnd ye shall be my people and I will be your GodBehold the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury a continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wickedThe fierce anger of the LORD shall not return until he have done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider itAt the same time saith the LORD will I be the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my peopleThus saith the LORD The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to restThe LORD hath appeared of old unto me saying Yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn theeAgain I will build thee and thou shalt be built O virgin of Israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merryThou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common thingsFor there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry Arise ye and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our GodFor thus saith the LORD Sing with gladness for Jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say O LORD save thy people the remnant of IsraelBehold I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thitherThey shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my firstbornHear the word of the LORD O ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say He that scattered Israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flockFor the LORD hath redeemed Jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than heTherefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at allThen shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrowAnd I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the LORDThus saith the LORD A voice was heard in Ramah lamentation and bitter weeping Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were notThus saith the LORD Refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the LORD and they shall come again from the land of the enemyAnd there is hope in thine end saith the LORD that thy children shall come again to their own borderI have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke turn thou me and I shall be turned for thou art the LORD my GodSurely after that I was turned I repented and after that I was instructed I smote upon my thigh I was ashamed yea even confounded because I did bear the reproach of my youthIs Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him I will surely have mercy upon him saith the LORDSet thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again O virgin of Israel turn again to these thy citiesHow long wilt thou go about O thou backsliding daughter for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth A woman shall compass a manThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof when I shall bring again their captivity The LORD bless thee O habitation of justice and mountain of holinessAnd there shall dwell in Judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocksFor I have satiated the weary soul and I have replenished every sorrowful soulUpon this I awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto meBehold the days come saith the LORD that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beastAnd it shall come to pass that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will I watch over them to build and to plant saith the LORDIn those days they shall say no more The fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edgeBut every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edgeBehold the days come saith the LORD that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of JudahNot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they brake although I was an husband unto them saith the LORDBut this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days saith the LORD I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my peopleAnd they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying Know the LORD for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the LORD for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no moreThus saith the LORD which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar The LORD of hosts is his nameIf those ordinances depart from before me saith the LORD then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for everThus saith the LORD If heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the LORDBehold the days come saith the LORD that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the cornerAnd the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb and shall compass about to GoathAnd the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the LORD it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for everThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the eighteenth year of NebuchadrezzarFor then the king of Babylons army besieged Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of Judahs houseFor Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up saying Wherefore dost thou prophesy and say Thus saith the LORD Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take itAnd Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyesAnd he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon and there shall he be until I visit him saith the LORD though ye fight with the Chaldeans ye shall not prosperAnd Jeremiah said The word of the LORD came unto me sayingBehold Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy itSo Hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD and said unto me Buy my field I pray thee that is in Anathoth which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself Then I knew that this was the word of the LORDAnd I bought the field of Hanameel my uncles son that was in Anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silverAnd I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balancesSo I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was openAnd I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah the son of Maaseiah in the sight of Hanameel mine uncles son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prisonAnd I charged Baruch before them sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many daysFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this landNow when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah I prayed unto the LORD sayingAh Lord GOD behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for theeThou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the Great the Mighty God the LORD of hosts is his nameGreat in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doingsWhich hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even unto this day and in Israel and among other men and hast made thee a name as at this dayAnd hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terrorAnd hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honeyAnd they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon themBehold the mounts they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest itAnd thou hast said unto me O Lord GOD Buy thee the field for money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the ChaldeansThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah sayingBehold I am the LORD the God of all flesh is there any thing too hard for meTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall take itAnd the Chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire on this city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to angerFor the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the LORDFor this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that I should remove it from before my faceBecause of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah which they have done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of JerusalemAnd they have turned unto me the back and not the face though I taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not hearkened to receive instructionBut they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile itAnd they built the high places of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech which I commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause Judah to sinAnd now therefore thus saith the LORD the God of Israel concerning this city whereof ye say It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilenceBehold I will gather them out of all countries whither I have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and I will bring them again unto this place and I will cause them to dwell safelyAnd they shall be my people and I will be their GodAnd I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after themAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them to do them good but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from meYea I will rejoice over them to do them good and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soulFor thus saith the LORD Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised themAnd fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say It is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the ChaldeansMen shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for I will cause their captivity to return saith the LORDMoreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison sayingThus saith the LORD the maker thereof the LORD that formed it to establish it the LORD is his nameCall unto me and I will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest notFor thus saith the LORD the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the swordThey come to fight with the Chaldeans but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this cityBehold I will bring it health and cure and I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truthAnd I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return and will build them as at the firstAnd I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against meAnd it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that I do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto itThus saith the LORD Again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beastThe voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say Praise the LORD of hosts for the LORD is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD For I will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the LORDThus saith the LORD of hosts Again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie downIn the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of Benjamin and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the LORDBehold the days come saith the LORD that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of JudahIn those days and at that time will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the landIn those days shall Judah be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called The LORD our righteousnessFor thus saith the LORD David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of IsraelNeither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continuallyAnd the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah sayingThus saith the LORD If ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their seasonThen may also my covenant be broken with David my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the Levites the priests my ministersAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will I multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites that minister unto meMoreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah sayingConsiderest thou not what this people have spoken saying The two families which the LORD hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before themThus saith the LORD If my covenant be not with day and night and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earthThen will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham Isaac and Jacob for I will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on themThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof sayingThus saith the LORD the God of Israel Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him Thus saith the LORD Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fireAnd thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to BabylonYet hear the word of the LORD O Zedekiah king of Judah Thus saith the LORD of thee Thou shalt not die by the swordBut thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying Ah lord for I have pronounced the word saith the LORDThen Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in JerusalemWhen the king of Babylons army fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left against Lachish and against Azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of JudahThis is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto themThat every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a Jew his brotherNow when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them goBut afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaidsTherefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD sayingThus saith the LORD the God of Israel I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondmen sayingAt the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their earAnd ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my nameBut ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaidsTherefore thus saith the LORD Ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold I proclaim a liberty for you saith the LORD to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earthAnd I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereofThe princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calfI will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earthAnd Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of Babylons army which are gone up from youBehold I will command saith the LORD and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitantThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah sayingGo unto the house of the Rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the LORD into one of the chambers and give them wine to drinkThen I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the RechabitesAnd I brought them into the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah a man of God which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the keeper of the doorAnd I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and cups and I said unto them Drink ye wineBut they said We will drink no wine for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us saying Ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for everNeither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangersThus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughtersNor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seedBut we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded usBut it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land that we said Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians so we dwell at JerusalemThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the LORDThe words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding I have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto meI have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying Return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto meBecause the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto meTherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken unto them but they have not heard and I have called unto them but they have not answeredAnd Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded youTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for everAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD sayingTake thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations from the day I spake unto thee from the days of Josiah even unto this dayIt may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sinThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a bookAnd Jeremiah commanded Baruch saying I am shut up I cannot go into the house of the LORDTherefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORDs house upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their citiesIt may be they will present their supplication before the LORD and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this peopleAnd Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORDs houseAnd it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto JerusalemThen read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the LORDs house in the ears of all the peopleWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the LORDThen he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the princes sat there even Elishama the scribe and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah and Elnathan the son of Achbor and Gemariah the son of Shaphan and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah and all the princesThen Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the peopleTherefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah the son of Shelemiah the son of Cushi unto Baruch saying Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto themAnd they said unto him Sit down now and read it in our ears So Baruch read it in their earsNow it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid both one and other and said unto Baruch We will surely tell the king of all these wordsAnd they asked Baruch saying Tell us now How didst thou write all these words at his mouthThen Baruch answered them He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and I wrote them with ink in the bookThen said the princes unto Baruch Go hide thee thou and Jeremiah and let no man know where ye beAnd they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the kingSo the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of Elishama the scribes chamber And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the kingNow the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before himAnd it came to pass that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearthYet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these wordsNevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear themBut the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet but the LORD hid themThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah sayingTake thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burnedAnd thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah Thus saith the LORD Thou hast burned this roll saying Why hast thou written therein saying The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beastTherefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frostAnd I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them but they hearkened notThen took Jeremiah another roll and gave it to Baruch the scribe the son of Neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like wordsAnd king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of JudahBut neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the LORD which he spake by the prophet JeremiahAnd Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah saying Pray now unto the LORD our God for usNow Jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prisonThen Pharoahs army was come forth out of Egypt and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from JerusalemThen came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah sayingThus saith the LORD the God of Israel Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah that sent you unto me to inquire of me Behold Pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to Egypt into their own landAnd the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fireThus saith the LORD Deceive not yourselves saying The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not departFor though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fireAnd it came to pass that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaohs armyThen Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the peopleAnd when he was in the gate of Benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah and he took Jeremiah the prophet saying Thou fallest away to the ChaldeansThen said Jeremiah It is false I fall not away to the Chaldeans But he hearkened not to him so Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princesWherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prisonWhen Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins and Jeremiah had remained there many daysThen Zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said Is there any word from the LORD And Jeremiah said There is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of BabylonMoreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah What have I offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prisonWhere are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this landTherefore hear now I pray thee O my lord the king let my supplication I pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe lest I die thereThen Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prisonThen Shephatiah the son of Mattan and Gedaliah the son of Pashur and Jucal the son of Shelemiah and Pashur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people sayingThus saith the LORD He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall liveThus saith the LORD This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylons army which shall take itTherefore the princes said unto the king We beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurtThen Zedekiah the king said Behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against youThen took they Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down Jeremiah with cords And in the dungeon there was no water but mire so Jeremiah sunk in the mireNow when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the kings house heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of BenjaminEbed-melech went forth out of the kings house and spake to the king sayingMy lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the cityThen the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian saying Take from hence thirty men with thee and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dieSo Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to JeremiahAnd Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords And Jeremiah did soSo they drew up Jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prisonThen Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD and the king said unto Jeremiah I will ask thee a thing hide nothing from meThen Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah If I declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if I give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto meSo Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah saying As the LORD liveth that made us this soul I will not put thee to death neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy lifeThen said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah Thus saith the LORD the God of hosts the God of Israel If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine houseBut if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their handAnd Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock meBut Jeremiah said They shall not deliver thee Obey I beseech thee the voice of the LORD which I speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall liveBut if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the LORD hath shewed meAnd behold all the women that are left in the king of Judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylons princes and those women shall say Thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away backSo they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fireThen said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah Let no man know of these words and thou shalt not dieBut if the princes hear that I have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto theeThen thou shalt say unto them I presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to Jonathans house to die thereThen came all the princes unto Jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded So they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceivedSo Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken and he was there when Jerusalem was takenIn the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem and they beseiged itAnd in the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month the city was broken upAnd all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even Nergal-sharezer Samgar-nebo Sarsechim Rab-saris Nergal-sharezer Rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of BabylonAnd it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plainBut the Chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath where he gave judgment upon himThen the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of JudahMoreover he put out Zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to BabylonAnd the Chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of JerusalemThen Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remainedBut Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of Judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same timeNow Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sayingTake him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto theeSo Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent and Nebushasban Rab-saris and Nergal-sharezer Rabmag and all the king of Babylons princesEven they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the peopleNow the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison sayingGo and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before theeBut I will deliver thee in that day saith the LORD and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraidFor I will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the LORDThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah which were carried away captive unto BabylonAnd the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said unto him The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this placeNow the LORD hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon youAnd now behold I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon come and I will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither goNow while he was not yet gone back he said Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him goThen went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the landNow when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to BabylonThen they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite they and their menAnd Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying Fear not to serve the Chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with youAs for me behold I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have takenLikewise when all the Jews that were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of ShaphanEven all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah unto Mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very muchMoreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah to MizpahAnd said unto him Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them notThen Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying Let me go I pray thee and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perishBut Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah Thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of IshmaelNow it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and there they did eat bread together in MizpahThen arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the landIshmael also slew all the Jews that were with him even with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Chaldeans that were found there and the men of warAnd it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah and no man knew itThat there came certain from Shechem from Shiloh and from Samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the LORDAnd Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them Come to Gedaliah the son of AhikamAnd it was so when they came into the midst of the city that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with himBut ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael Slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey So he forbare and slew them not among their brethrenNow the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of Gedaliah was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slainThen Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people that remained in Mizpah whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the AmmonitesBut when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had doneThen they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in GibeonNow it came to pass that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were gladSo all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned and went unto Johanan the son of KareahBut Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the AmmonitesThen took Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah from Mizpah after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from GibeonAnd they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham which is by Bethlehem to go to enter into EgyptBecause of the Chaldeans for they were afraid of them because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon made governor in the landThen all the captains of the forces and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came nearAnd said unto Jeremiah the prophet Let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the LORD thy God even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold usThat the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may doThen Jeremiah the prophet said unto them I have heard you behold I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you I will declare it unto you I will keep nothing back from youThen they said to Jeremiah The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to usWhether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our GodAnd it came to pass after ten days that the word of the LORD came unto JeremiahThen called he Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatestAnd said unto them Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before himIf ye will still abide in this land then will I build you and not pull you down and I will plant you and not pluck you up for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto youBe not afraid of the king of Babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the LORD for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his handAnd I will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own landBut if ye say We will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the LORD your GodSaying No but we will go into the land of Egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwellAnd now therefore hear the word of the LORD ye remnant of Judah Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt and go to sojourn thereThen it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt and there ye shall dieSo shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon themFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into Egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no moreThe LORD hath said concerning you O ye remnant of Judah Go ye not into Egypt know certainly that I have admonished you this dayFor ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the LORD your God saying Pray for us unto the LORD our God and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say so declare unto us and we will do itAnd now I have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto youNow therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojournAnd it came to pass that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God for which the LORD their God had sent him to them even all these wordsThen spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the proud men saying unto Jeremiah Thou speakest falsely the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say Go not into Egypt to sojourn thereBut Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into BabylonSo Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of the LORD to dwell in the land of JudahBut Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of JudahEven men and women and children and the kings daughters and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of NeriahSo they came into the land of Egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD thus came they even to TahpanhesThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes sayingTake great stones in thine hand and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes in the sight of the men of JudahAnd say unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over themAnd when he cometh he shall smite the land of Egypt and deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the swordAnd I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peaceHe shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh that is in the land of Egypt and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fireThe word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt which dwell at Migdol and at Tahpanhes and at Noph and in the country of Pathros sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth thereinBecause of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathersHowbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising early and sending them saying Oh do not this abominable thing that I hateBut they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other godsWherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this dayTherefore now this saith the LORD the God of hosts the God of Israel Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of Judah to leave you none to remainIn that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earthHave ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of Judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of JerusalemThey are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that I set before you and before your fathersTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all JudahAnd I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproachFor I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilenceSo that none of the remnant of Judah which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of Judah to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as shall escapeThen all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered Jeremiah sayingAs for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD we will not hearken unto theeBut we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evilBut since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famineAnd when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her without our menThen Jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and to all the people which had given him that answer sayingThe incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the LORD remember them and came it not into his mindSo that the LORD could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this dayBecause ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this dayMoreover Jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women Hear the word of the LORD all Judah that are in the land of EgyptThus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel saying Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hand saying We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vowsTherefore hear ye the word of the LORD all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt Behold I have sworn by my great name saith the LORD that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying The Lord GOD livethBehold I will watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of themYet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah and all the remnant of Judah that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand mine or theirsAnd this shall be a sign unto you saith the LORD that I will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evilThus saith the LORD Behold I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon his enemy and that sought his lifeThe word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah sayingThus saith the LORD the God of Israel unto thee O BaruchThou didst say Woe is me now for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow I fainted in my sighing and I find no restThus shalt thou say unto him The LORD saith thus Behold that which I have built will I break down and that which I have planted I will pluck up even this whole landAnd seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold I will bring evil upon all flesh saith the LORD but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goestThe word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the GentilesAgainst Egypt against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of JudahOrder ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battleHarness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandinesWherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not back for fear was round about saith the LORDLet not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river EuphratesWho is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as the riversEgypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are moved like the rivers and he saith I will go up and will cover the earth I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereofCome up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men come forth the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield and the Lydians that handle and bend the bowFor this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river EuphratesGo up into Gilead and take balm O virgin the daughter of Egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be curedThe nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they are fallen both togetherThe word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of EgyptDeclare ye in Egypt and publish in Migdol and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes say ye Stand fast and prepare thee for the sword shall devour round about theeWhy are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the LORD did drive themHe made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said Arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing swordThey did cry there Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise he hath passed the time appointedAs I live saith the King whose name is the LORD of hosts Surely as Tabor is among the mountains and as Carmel by the sea so shall he comeO thou daughter dwelling in Egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitantEgypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it cometh out of the northAlso her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and the time of their visitationThe voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of woodThey shall cut down her forest saith the LORD though it cannot be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are innumerableThe daughter of Egypt shall be confounded she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the northThe LORD of hosts the God of Israel saith Behold I will punish the multitude of No and Pharaoh and Egypt with their gods and their kings even Pharaoh and all them that trust in himAnd I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith the LORDBut fear not thou O my servant Jacob and be not dismayed O Israel for behold I will save thee from afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and be in rest and at ease and none shall make him afraidFear thou not O Jacob my servant saith the LORD for I am with thee for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee but I will not make a full end of thee but correct thee in measure yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunishedThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines before that Pharaoh smote GazaThus saith the LORD Behold waters rise up out of the north and shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howlAt the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of handsBecause of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth for the LORD will spoil the Philistines the remnant of the country of CaphtorBaldness is come upon Gaza Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyselfO thou sword of the LORD how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be stillHow can it be quiet seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed itAgainst Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Woe unto Nebo for it is spoiled Kiriathaim is confounded and taken Misgab is confounded and dismayedThere shall be no more praise of Moab in Heshbon they have devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a nation Also thou shalt be cut down O Madmen the sword shall pursue theeA voice of crying shall be from Horonaim spoiling and great destructionMoab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heardFor in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destructionFlee save your lives and be like the heath in the wildernessFor because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou shalt also be taken and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes togetherAnd the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the LORD hath spokenGive wings unto Moab that it may flee and get away for the cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell thereinCursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from bloodMoab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and his scent is not changedTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that I will send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall empty his vessels and break their bottlesAnd Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidenceHow say ye We are mighty and strong men for the warMoab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the King whose name is the LORD of hostsThe calamity of Moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fastAll ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his name say How is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rodThou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon come down from thy glory and sit in thirst for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee and he shall destroy thy strong holdsO inhabitant of Aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth and say What is doneMoab is confounded for it is broken down howl and cry and tell ye it in Arnon that Moab is spoiledAnd judgment is come upon the plain country upon Holon and upon Jahazah and upon MephaathAnd upon Dibon and upon Nebo and upon Beth-diblathaimAnd upon Kiriathaim and upon Beth-gamul and upon Beth-meonAnd upon Kerioth and upon Bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of Moab far or nearThe horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the LORDMake ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the LORD Moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derisionFor was not Israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joyO ye that dwell in Moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouthWe have heard the pride of Moab he is exceeding proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heartI know his wrath saith the LORD but it shall not be so his lies shall not so effect itTherefore will I howl for Moab and I will cry out for all Moab mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir-heresO vine of Sibmah I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of Jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintageAnd joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shoutingFrom the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh and even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice from Zoar even unto Horonaim as an heifer of three years old for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolateMoreover I will cause to cease in Moab saith the LORD him that offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his godsTherefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres because the riches that he hath gotten are perishedFor every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackclothThere shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure saith the LORDThey shall howl saying How is it broken down how hath Moab turned the back with shame so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about himFor thus saith the LORD Behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over MoabKerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the mighty mens hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangsAnd Moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the LORDFear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee O inhabitant of Moab saith the LORDHe that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for I will bring upon it even upon Moab the year of their visitation saith the LORDThey that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous onesWoe be unto thee O Moab the people of Chemosh perisheth for thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captivesYet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days saith the LORD Thus far is the judgment of MoabConcerning the Ammonites thus saith the LORD Hath Israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit Gad and his people dwell in his citiesTherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned with fire then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs saith the LORDHowl O Heshbon for Ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of Rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes togetherWherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley O backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying Who shall come unto meBehold I will bring a fear upon thee saith the Lord GOD of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that wanderethAnd afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon saith the LORDConcerning Edom thus saith the LORD of hosts Is wisdom no more in Teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom vanishedFlee ye turn back dwell deep O inhabitants of Dedan for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him the time that I will visit himIf grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have enoughBut I have made Esau bare I have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbours and he is notLeave thy fatherless children I will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in meFor thus saith the LORD Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink of itFor I have sworn by myself saith the LORD that Bozrah shall become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastesI have heard a rumour from the LORD and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen saying Gather ye together and come against her and rise up to the battleFor lo I will make thee small among the heathen and despised among menThy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine heart O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle I will bring thee down from thence saith the LORDAlso Edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereofAs in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the LORD no man shall abide there neither shall a son of man dwell in itBehold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong but I will suddenly make him run away from her and who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before meTherefore hear the counsel of the LORD that he hath taken against Edom and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations desolate with themThe earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red seaBehold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangsConcerning Damascus Hamath is confounded and Arpad for they have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quietDamascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travailHow is the city of praise not left the city of my joyTherefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the LORD of hostsAnd I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadadConcerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite thus saith the LORD Arise ye go up to Kedar and spoil the men of the eastTheir tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels and they shall cry unto them Fear is on every sideFlee get you far off dwell deep O ye inhabitants of Hazor saith the LORD for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against youArise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care saith the LORD which have neither gates nor bars which dwell aloneAnd their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their cattle a spoil and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof saith the LORDAnd Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in itThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will break the bow of Elam the chief of their mightAnd upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not comeFor I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger saith the LORD and I will send the sword after them till I have consumed themAnd I will set my throne in Elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the LORDBut it shall come to pass in the latter days that I will bring again the captivity of Elam saith the LORDThe word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophetDeclare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say Babylon is taken Bel is confounded Merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are broken in piecesFor out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and beastIn those days and in that time saith the LORD the children of Israel shall come they and the children of Judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the LORD their GodThey shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward saying Come and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgottenMy people hath been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplaceAll that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said We offend not because they have sinned against the LORD the habitation of justice even the LORD the hope of their fathersRemove out of the midst of Babylon and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocksFor lo I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country and they shall set themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man none shall return in vainAnd Chaldea shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be satisfied saith the LORDBecause ye were glad because ye rejoiced O ye destroyers of mine heritage because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and bellow as bullsYour mother shall be sore confounded she that bare you shall be ashamed behold the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness a dry land and a desertBecause of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited but it shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plaguesPut yourselves in array against Babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against the LORDShout against her round about she hath given her hand her foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of the LORD take vengeance upon her as she hath done do unto herCut off the sower from Babylon and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own landIsrael is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of Assyria hath devoured him and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bonesTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I have punished the king of AssyriaAnd I will bring Israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and GileadIn those days and in that time saith the LORD the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserveGo up against the land of Merathaim even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod waste and utterly destroy after them saith the LORD and do according to all that I have commanded theeA sound of battle is in the land and of great destructionHow is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how is Babylon become a desolation among the nationsI have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken O Babylon and thou wast not aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against the LORDThe LORD hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the ChaldeansCome against her from the utmost border open her storehouses cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be leftSlay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them for their day is come the time

dismayedA sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbedA drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it is the land of graven images and they are mad upon their idolsTherefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there and the owls shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generationAs God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the LORD so shall no man abide there neither shall any son of man dwell thereinBehold a people shall come from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be

travailBehold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong but I will make them suddenly run away from her and who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before meTherefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD that he hath taken against Babylon and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitation desolate with themAt the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved and the cry is heard among the nationsThus saith the LORD Behold I will raise up against Babylon and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me a destroying windAnd will send unto Babylon fanners that shall fan her and shall empty her land for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round aboutAgainst him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine and spare ye not her young men destroy ye utterly all her hostThus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans and they that are thrust through in her streetsFor Israel hath not been forsaken nor Judah of his God of the LORD of hosts though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of IsraelFlee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver every man his soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the LORDs vengeance he will render unto her a recompenceBabylon hath been a golden cup in the

watchmen prepare the ambushes for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of BabylonO thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures thine end is come and the measure of thy covetousnessThe LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself saying Surely I will fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a shout against theeHe hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heaven by his understandingWhen he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuresEvery man is brutish by his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in themThey are vanity the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perishThe portion of Jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and Israel is the rod of his inheritance the LORD of hosts is his nameThou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will I break in pieces the nations and with thee will I destroy kingdomsAnd with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his riderWith thee also will I break in pieces man and woman and with thee will I break in pieces old and young and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maidI will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulersAnd I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight saith the LORDBehold I am against thee O destroying mountain saith the LORD which destroyest all the earth and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountainAnd they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever saith the LORDSet ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat Minni and Ashchenaz appoint a captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillersPrepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes the captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his dominionAnd the land shall tremble and sorrow for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitantThe mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight they have remained in their holds their might hath failed they became as women they have burned her dwellingplaces her bars are brokenOne post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet another to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one endAnd that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrightedFor thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall comeNebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me he hath crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicates he hath cast me outThe violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon shall the inhabitant of Zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea shall Jerusalem sayTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will plead thy cause and take vengeance for thee and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dryAnd Babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for dragons an astonishment and an hissing without an inhabitantThey shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions whelpsIn their heat I will make their feasts and I will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the LORDI will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams with he goatsHow is Sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nationsThe sea is come up upon Babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereofHer cities are a desolation a dry land and a wilderness a land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass therebyAnd I will punish Bel in Babylon and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him yea the wall of Babylon shall fallMy people go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORDAnd lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land ruler against rulerTherefore behold the days come that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain shall fall in the midst of herThen the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall sing for Babylon for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north saith the LORDAs Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earthYe that have escaped the sword go away stand not still remember the LORD afar off and let Jerusalem come into your mindWe are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORDs houseWherefore behold the days come saith the LORD that I will do judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groanThough Babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall spoilers come unto her saith the LORDA sound of a cry cometh from Babylon and great destruction from the land of the ChaldeansBecause the LORD hath spoiled Babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do roar like great waters a noise of their voice is utteredBecause the spoiler is come upon her even upon Babylon and her mighty men are taken every one of their bows is broken for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requiteAnd I will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the King whose name is the LORD of hostsThus saith the LORD of hosts The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be wearyThe word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah the son of Maaseiah when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign And this Seraiah was a quiet princeSo Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon even all these words that are written against BabylonAnd Jeremiah said to Seraiah When thou comest to Babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these wordsThen shalt thou say O LORD thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that none shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for everAnd it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of EuphratesAnd thou shalt say Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her and they shall be weary Thus far are the words of JeremiahZedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of LibnahAnd he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD according to all that Jehoiakim had doneFor through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah till he had cast them out from his presence that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of BabylonAnd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came he and all his army against Jerusalem and pitched against it and built forts against it round aboutSo the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king ZedekiahAnd in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the landThen the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the Chaldeans were by the city round about and they went by the way of the plainBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from himThen they took the king and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath where he gave judgment upon himAnd the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of Judah in RiblahThen he put out the eyes of Zedekiah and the king of Babylon bound him in chains and carried him to Babylon and put him in prison till the day of his deathNow in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard which served the king of Babylon into JerusalemAnd burned the house of the LORD and the kings house and all the houses of Jerusalem and all the houses of the great men burned he with fireAnd all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round aboutThen Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of Babylon and the rest of the multitudeBut Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmenAlso the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD the Chaldeans brake and carried all the brass of them to BabylonThe caldrons also and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they awayAnd the basons and the firepans and the bowls and the caldrons and the candlesticks and the spoons and the cups that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver took the captain of the guard awayThe two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD the brass of all these vessels was without weightAnd concerning the pillars the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it and the thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollowAnd a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of one chapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about all of brass The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto theseAnd there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round aboutAnd the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the doorHe took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the citySo Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to RiblahAnd the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own landThis is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twentyIn the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two personsIn the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons all the persons were four thousand and six hundredAnd it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day of the month that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth out of prisonAnd spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in BabylonAnd changed his prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his lifeAnd for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all the days of his lifeHow doth the city sit solitary that was full of people  how is she become as a widow she that was was great among the nations and princess among the provinces how is she become tributaryShe weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they are become her enemiesJudah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest all her persecutors overtook her between the straitsThe ways of Zion do mourn because none come to the solemn feasts all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins are afflicted and she is in bitternessHer adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her children are gone into captivity before the enemyAnd from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed her princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone without strength before the pursuerJerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her the adversaries saw her and did mock at her sabbathsJerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is removed all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yea she sigheth and turneth backwardHer filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter O LORD behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himselfThe adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregationAll her people sigh they seek bread they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul see O LORD and consider for I am become vileIs it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce angerFrom above hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back he hath made me desolate and faint all the dayThe yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand they are wreathed and come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to fall the Lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom I am not able to rise upThe Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men the Lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of Judah as in a winepressFor these things I weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailedZion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries should be round about him Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among themThe LORD is righteous for I have rebelled against his commandment hear I pray you all people and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivityI called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to relieve their soulsBehold O LORD for I am in distress my bowels are troubled mine heart is turned within me for I have grievously rebelled abroad the sword bereaveth at home there is as deathThey have heard that I sigh there is none to comfort me all mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall be like unto meLet all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are many and my heart is faintHow hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel and remembered not his footstool in the day of his angerThe Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob and hath not pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereofHe hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round aboutHe hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion he poured out his fury like fireThe Lord was as an enemy he hath swallowed up Israel he hath swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentationAnd he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priestThe Lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces they have made a noise in the house of the LORD as in the day of a solemn feastThe LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament they languished togetherHer gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bars her king and her princes are among the Gentiles the law is no more her prophets also find no vision from the LORDThe elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and keep silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the groundMine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the cityThey say to their mothers Where is corn and wine when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was poured out into their mothers bosomWhat thing shall I take to witness for thee what thing shall I liken to thee O daughter of Jerusalem what shall I equal to thee that I may comfort thee O virgin daughter of Zion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heal theeThy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishmentAll that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem saying Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty The joy of the whole earthAll thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and gnash the teeth they say We have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we looked for we have found we have seen itThe LORD hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversariesTheir heart cried unto the Lord O wall of the daughter of Zion let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no rest let not the apple of thine eye ceaseArise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every streetBehold O LORD and consider to whom thou hast done this Shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the LordThe young and the old lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger thou hast killed and not pitiedThou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about so that in the day of the LORDs anger none escaped nor remained those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumedI am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrathHe hath led me and brought me into darkness but not into lightSurely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all the dayMy flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bonesHe hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and travailHe hath set me in dark places as they that be dead of oldHe hath hedged me about that I cannot get out he hath made my chain heavyAlso when I cry and shout he shutteth out my prayerHe hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths crookedHe was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret placesHe hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath made me desolateHe hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrowHe hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reinsI was a derision to all my people and their song all the dayHe hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with wormwoodHe hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered me with ashesAnd thou hast removed my soul far off from peace I forgat prosperityAnd I said My strength and my hope is perished from the LORDRemembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gallMy soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in meThis I recall to my mind therefore have I hopeIt is of the LORDs mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail notThey are new every morning great is thy faithfulnessThe LORD is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in himThe LORD is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh himIt is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORDIt is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youthHe sitteth alone and keepeth silence because he hath borne it upon himHe putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hopeHe giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him he is filled full with reproachFor the Lord will not cast off for everBut though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his merciesFor he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of menTo crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earthTo turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most HighTo subvert a man in his cause the Lord approveth notWho is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it notOut of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and goodWherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sinsLet us search and try our ways and turn again to the LORDLet us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavensWe have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardonedThou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain thou hast not pitiedThou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass throughThou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peopleAll our enemies have opened their mouths against usFear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destructionMine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my peopleMine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any intermissionTill the LORD look down and behold from heavenMine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my cityMine enemies chased me sore like a bird without causeThey have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon meWaters flowed over mine head then I said I am cut offI called upon thy name O LORD out of the low dungeonThou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cryThou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee thou saidst Fear notO Lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast redeemed my lifeO LORD thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my causeThou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against meThou hast heard their reproach O LORD and all their imaginations against meThe lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the dayBehold their sitting down and their rising up I am their musickRender unto them a recompence O LORD according to the work of their handsGive them sorrow of heart thy curse unto themPersecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORDHow is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every streetThe precious sons of Zion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potterEven the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the ostriches in the wildernessThe tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto themThey that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghillsFor the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hands stayed on herHer Nazarites were purer than snow they were whiter than milk they were more ruddy in body than rubies their polishing was of sapphireTheir visage is blacker than a coal they are not known in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it is become like a stickThey that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of the fruits of the fieldThe hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my peopleThe LORD hath accomplished his fury he hath poured out his fierce anger and hath kindled a fire in Zion and it hath devoured the foundations thereofThe kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of JerusalemFor the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of herThey have wandered as blind men in the streets they have polluted themselves with blood so that men could not touch their garmentsThey cried unto them Depart ye it is unclean depart depart touch not when they fled away and wandered they said among the heathen They shall no more sojourn thereThe anger of the LORD hath divided them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favoured not the eldersAs for us our eyes as yet failed for our vain help in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save usThey hunt our steps that we cannot go in our streets our end is near our days are fulfilled for our end is comeOur persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven they pursued us upon the mountains they laid wait for us in the wildernessThe breath of our nostrils the anointed of the LORD was taken in their pits of whom we said Under his shadow we shall live among the heathenRejoice and be glad O daughter of Edom that dwellest in the land of Uz the cup also shall pass through unto thee thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself nakedThe punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished O daughter of Zion he will no more carry thee away into captivity he will visit thine iniquity O daughter of Edom he will discover thy sinsRemember O LORD what is come upon us consider and behold our reproachOur inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliensWe are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widowsWe have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto usOur necks are under persecution we labour and have no restWe have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians to be satisfied with breadOur fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquitiesServants have ruled over us there is none that doth deliver us out of their handWe gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wildernessOur skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famineThey ravished the women in Zion and the maids in the cities of JudahPrinces are hanged up by their hand the faces of elders were not honouredThey took the young men to grind and the children fell under the woodThe elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their musickThe joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into mourningThe crown is fallen from our head woe unto us that we have sinnedFor this our heart is faint for these things our eyes are dimBecause of the mountain of Zion which is desolate the foxes walk upon itThou O LORD remainest for ever thy throne from generation to generationWherefore dost thou forget us for ever and forsake us so long timeTurn thou us unto thee O LORD and we shall be turned renew our days as of oldBut thou hast utterly rejected us thou art very wroth against usNow it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of GodIn the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachins captivityThe word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar and the hand of the LORD was there upon himAnd I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fireAlso out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures And this was their appearance they had the likeness of a manAnd every one had four faces and every one had four wingsAnd their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brassAnd they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wingsTheir wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forwardAs for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagleThus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodiesAnd they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they wentAs for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightningAnd the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightningNow as I beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four facesThe appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheelWhen they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they wentAs for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them fourAnd when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted upWhithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheelsWhen those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheelsAnd the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads aboveAnd under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodiesAnd when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the Almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wingsAnd there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wingsAnd above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon itAnd I saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round aboutAs the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD And when I saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of one that spakeAnd he said unto me Son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto theeAnd the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that I heard him that spake unto meAnd he said unto me Son of man I send thee to the children of Israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very dayFor they are impudent children and stiffhearted I do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the Lord GODAnd they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among themAnd thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious houseAnd thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebelliousBut thou son of man hear what I say unto thee Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that I give theeAnd when I looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was thereinAnd he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woeMoreover he said unto me Son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of IsraelSo I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that rollAnd he said unto me Son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee Then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetnessAnd he said unto me Son of man go get thee unto the house of Israel and speak with my words unto themFor thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of IsraelNot to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand Surely had I sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto theeBut the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardheartedBehold I have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheadsAs an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious houseMoreover he said unto me Son of man all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine earsAnd go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them Thus saith the Lord GOD whether they will hear or whether they will forbearThen the spirit took me up and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his placeI heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushingSo the spirit lifted me up and took me away and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the LORD was strong upon meThen I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib that dwelt by the river of Chebar and I sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven daysAnd it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from meWhen I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine handYet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soulAgain When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and I lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require at thine handNevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soulAnd the hand of the LORD was there upon me and he said unto me Arise go forth into the plain and I will there talk with theeThen I arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the LORD stood there as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar and I fell on my faceThen the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me Go shut thyself within thine houseBut thou O son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among themAnd I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious houseBut when I speak with thee I will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD He that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious houseThou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even JerusalemAnd lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round aboutMoreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it This shall be a sign to the house of IsraelLie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquityFor I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of IsraelAnd when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days I have appointed thee each day for a yearTherefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against itAnd behold I will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siegeTake thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereofAnd thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat itThou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drinkAnd thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sightAnd the LORD said Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles whither I will drive themThen said I Ah Lord GOD behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouthThen he said unto me Lo I have given thee cows dung for mans dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewithMoreover he said unto me Son of man behold I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishmentThat they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquityAnd thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barbers rasor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weight and divide the hairThou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and I will draw out a sword after themThou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirtsThen take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of IsraelThus saith the Lord GOD This is Jerusalem I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about herAnd she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in themTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about youTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I even I am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nationsAnd I will do in thee that which I have not done and whereunto I will not do any more the like because of all thine abominationsTherefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and I will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the windsWherefore as I live saith the Lord GOD Surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will I also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will I have any pityA third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a third part into all the winds and I will draw out a sword after themThus shall mine anger be accomplished and I will cause my fury to rest upon them and I will be comforted and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal when I have accomplished my fury in themMoreover I will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass bySo it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes I the LORD have spoken itWhen I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which I will send to destroy you and I will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of breadSo will I send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and I will bring the sword upon thee I the LORD have spoken itAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against themAnd say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord GOD Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys Behold I even I will bring a sword upon you and I will destroy your high placesAnd your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be broken and I will cast down your slain men before your idolsAnd I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols and I will scatter your bones round about your altarsIn all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images may be cut down and your works may be abolishedAnd the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that I am the LORDYet will I leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countriesAnd they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because I am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominationsAnd they shall know that I am the LORD and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto themThus saith the Lord GOD Smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilenceHe that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will I accomplish my fury upon themThen shall ye know that I am the LORD when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idolsSo will I stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that I am the LORDMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingAlso thou son of man thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel An end the end is come upon the four corners of the landNow is the end come upon thee and I will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominationsAnd mine eye shall not spare thee neither will I have pity but I will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that I am the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD An evil an only evil behold is comeAn end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it is comeThe morning is come unto thee O thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountainsNow will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine anger upon thee and I will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense thee for all thine abominationsAnd mine eye shall not spare neither will I have pity I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smitethBehold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath buddedViolence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for themThe time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereofFor the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his lifeThey have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereofThe sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour himBut they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one for his iniquityAll hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as waterThey shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their headsThey shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquityAs for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein therefore have I set it far from themAnd I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute itMy face will I turn also from them and they shall pollute my secret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile itMake a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violenceWherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be defiledDestruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be noneMischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon rumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancientsThe king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled I will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will I judge them and they shall know that I am the LORDAnd it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as I sat in mine house and the elders of Judah sat before me that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon meThen I beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amberAnd he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousyAnd behold the glory of the God of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plainThen said he unto me Son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entryHe said furthermore unto me Son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here that I should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominationsAnd he brought me to the door of the court and when I looked behold a hole in the wallThen said he unto me Son of man dig now in the wall and when I had digged in the wall behold a doorAnd he said unto me Go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do hereSo I went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel pourtrayed upon the wall round aboutAnd there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went upThen said he unto me Son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say The LORD seeth us not the LORD hath forsaken the earthHe said also unto me Turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they doThen he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORDs house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for TammuzThen said he unto me Hast thou seen this O son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than theseAnd he brought me into the inner court of the LORDs house and behold at the door of the temple of the LORD between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the eastThen he said unto me Hast thou seen this O son of man Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their noseTherefore will I also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will I have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear themHe cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his handAnd behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altarAnd the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house And he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his sideAnd the LORD said unto him Go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereofAnd to the others he said in mine hearing Go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pitySlay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary Then they began at the ancient men which were before the houseAnd he said unto them Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth And they went forth and slew in the cityAnd it came to pass while they were slaying them and I was left that I fell upon my face and cried and said Ah Lord GOD wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon JerusalemThen said he unto me The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say The LORD hath forsaken the earth and the LORD seeth notAnd as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their headAnd behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou hast commanded meThen I looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throneAnd he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said Go in between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city And he went in in my sightNow the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner courtThen the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the LORDs gloryAnd the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the Almighty God when he speakethAnd it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying Take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheelsAnd one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went outAnd there appeared in the cherubims the form of a mans hand under their wingsAnd when I looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stoneAnd as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheelWhen they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they wentAnd their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four hadAs for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing O wheelAnd every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagleAnd the cherubims were lifted up This is the living creature that I saw by the river of ChebarAnd when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside themWhen they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in themThen the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubimsAnd the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORDs house and the glory of the God of Israel was over them aboveThis is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar and I knew that they were the cherubimsEvery one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wingsAnd the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forwardMoreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the LORDs house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah the princes of the peopleThen said he unto me Son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this cityWhich say It is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the fleshTherefore prophesy against them prophesy O son of manAnd the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me and said unto me Speak Thus saith the LORD Thus have ye said O house of Israel for I know the things that come into your mind every one of themYe have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slainTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but I will bring you forth out of the midst of itYe have feared the sword and I will bring a sword upon you saith the Lord GODAnd I will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among youYe shall fall by the sword I will judge you in the border of Israel and ye shall know that I am the LORDThis city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but I will judge you in the border of IsraelAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about youAnd it came to pass when I prophesied that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died Then fell I down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said Ah Lord GOD wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of IsraelAgain the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of Israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said Get you far from the LORD unto us is this land given in possessionTherefore say Thus saith the Lord GOD Although I have cast them far off among the heathen and although I have scattered them among the countries yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall comeTherefore say Thus saith the Lord GOD I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and I will give you the land of IsraelAnd they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thenceAnd I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of fleshThat they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their GodBut as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations I will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the Lord GODThen did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the God of Israel was over them aboveAnd the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the cityAfterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea to them of the captivity So the vision that I had seen went up from meThen I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed meThe word of the LORD also came unto me sayingSon of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious houseTherefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they be a rebellious houseThen shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivityDig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out therebyIn their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of IsraelAnd I did so as I was commanded I brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand I brought it forth in the twilight and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sightAnd in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me sayingSon of man hath not the house of Israel the rebellious house said unto thee What doest thouSay thou unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel that are among themSay I am your sign like as I have done so shall it be done unto them they shall remove and go into captivityAnd the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyesMy net also will I spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die thereAnd I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him and all his bands and I will draw out the sword after themAnd they shall know that I am the LORD when I shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countriesBut I will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that I am the LORDMoreover the word of the LORD came to me sayingSon of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulnessAnd say unto the people of the land Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel They shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell thereinAnd the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that I am the LORDAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel saying The days are prolonged and every vision failethTell them therefore Thus saith the Lord GOD I will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but say unto them The days are at hand and the effect of every visionFor there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of IsraelFor I am the LORD I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days O rebellious house will I say the word and will perform it saith the Lord GODAgain the word of the LORD came to me sayingSon of man behold they of the house of Israel say The vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far offTherefore say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD There shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which I have spoken shall be done saith the Lord GODAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts Hear ye the word of the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothingO Israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the desertsYe have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORDThey have seen vanity and lying divination saying The LORD saith and the LORD hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the wordHave ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say The LORD saith it albeit I have not spokenTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold I am against you saith the Lord GODAnd mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel neither shall they enter into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord GODBecause even because they have seduced my people saying Peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morterSay unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye O great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend itLo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed itTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in my fury to consume itSo will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that I am the LORDThus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you The wall is no more neither they that daubed itTo wit the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the Lord GODLikewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against themAnd say Thus saith the Lord GOD Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls Will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto youAnd will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your liesWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and I will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make them flyYour kerchiefs also will I tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that I am the LORDBecause with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom I have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him lifeTherefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for I will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that I am the LORDThen came certain of the elders of Israel unto me and sat before meAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should I be inquired of at all by themTherefore speak unto them and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idolsThat I may take the house of Israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idolsTherefore say unto the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD Repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominationsFor every one of the house of Israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me I the LORD will answer him by myselfAnd I will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and I will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that I am the LORDAnd if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing I the LORD have deceived that prophet and I will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people IsraelAnd they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto himThat the house of Israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and I may be their God saith the Lord GODThe word of the LORD came again to me sayingSon of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will I stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from itThough these three men Noah Daniel and Job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the Lord GODIf I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beastsThough these three men were in it as I live saith the Lord GOD they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolateOr if I bring a sword upon that land and say Sword go through the land so that I cut off man and beast from itThough these three men were in it as I live saith the Lord GOD they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselvesOr if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beastThough Noah Daniel and Job were in it as I live saith the Lord GOD they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousnessFor thus saith the Lord GOD How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beastYet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem even concerning all that I have brought upon itAnd they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it saith the Lord GODAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man What is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forestShall wood be taken thereof to do any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereonBehold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned Is it meet for any workBehold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burnedTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD As the vine tree among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel so will I give the inhabitants of JerusalemAnd I will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that I am the LORD when I set my face against themAnd I will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the Lord GODAgain the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man cause Jerusalem to know her abominationsAnd say Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan thy father was an Amorite and thy mother an HittiteAnd as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at allNone eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast bornAnd when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood Live yea I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood LiveI have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas thou wast naked and bareNow when I passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea I sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the Lord GOD and thou becamest mineThen washed I thee with water yea I throughly washed away thy blood from thee and I anointed thee with oilI clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers skin and I girded thee about with fine linen and I covered thee with silkI decked thee also with ornaments and I put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neckAnd I put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine headThus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdomAnd thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which I had put upon thee saith the Lord GODBut thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by his it wasAnd of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the like things shall not come neither shall it be soThou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which I had given thee and madest to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with themAnd tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before themMy meat also which I gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith I fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the Lord GODMoreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured Is this of thy whoredoms a small matterThat thou hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for themAnd in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy bloodAnd it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the Lord GODThat thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every streetThou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredomsThou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to provoke me to angerBehold therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the Philistines which are ashamed of thy lewd wayThou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians because thou wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet couldest not be satisfiedThou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied herewithHow weak is thine heart saith the Lord GOD seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious whorish womanIn that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an harlot in that thou scornest hireBut as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husbandThey give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredomAnd the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art contraryWherefore O harlot hear the word of the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto themBehold therefore I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated I will even gather them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakednessAnd I will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousyAnd I will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels and leave thee naked and bareThey shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swordsAnd they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any moreSo will I make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and I will be quiet and will be no more angryBecause thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast fretted me in all these things behold therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head saith the Lord GOD and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominationsBehold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying As is the mother so is her daughterThou art thy mothers daughter that lotheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands and their children your mother was an Hittite and your father an AmoriteAnd thine elder sister is Samaria she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom and her daughtersYet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy waysAs I live saith the Lord GOD Sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughtersBehold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needyAnd they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore I took them away as I saw goodNeither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast doneThou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sistersWhen I shall bring again their captivity the captivity of Sodom and her daughters and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of themThat thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto themWhen thy sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estateFor thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy prideBefore thy wickedness was discovered as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria and all that are round about her the daughters of the Philistines which despise thee round aboutThou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the LORDFor thus saith the Lord GOD I will even deal with thee as thou hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenantNevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenantThen thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and I will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenantAnd I will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that I am the LORDThat thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the Lord GODAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of IsraelAnd say Thus saith the Lord GOD A great eagle with great wings longwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came unto Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedarHe cropped off the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick he set it in a city of merchantsHe took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow treeAnd it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigsThere was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantationIt was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vineSay thou Thus saith the Lord GOD Shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereofYea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the furrows where it grewMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSay now to the rebellious house Know ye not what these things mean tell them Behold the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem and hath taken the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to BabylonAnd hath taken of the kings seed and made a covenant with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighty of the landThat the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might standBut he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt that they might give him horses and much people Shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break the covenant and be deliveredAs I live saith the Lord GOD surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall dieNeither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many personsSeeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escapeTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD As I live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even it will I recompense upon his own headAnd I will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and I will bring him to Babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against meAnd all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken itThus saith the Lord GOD I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar and will set it I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminentIn the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwellAnd all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish I the LORD have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish I the LORD have spoken and have done itThe word of the LORD came unto me again sayingWhat mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edgeAs I live saith the Lord GOD ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in IsraelBehold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall dieBut if a man be just and do that which is lawful and rightAnd hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel neither hath defiled his neighbours wife neither hath come near to a menstruous womanAnd hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garmentHe that hath not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between man and manHath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the Lord GODIf he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these thingsAnd that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbours wifeHath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abominationHath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon himNow lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such likeThat hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel hath not defiled his neighbours wifeNeither hath oppressed any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garmentThat hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely liveAs for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquityYet say ye Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father When the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely liveThe soul that sinneth it shall die The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himBut if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not dieAll his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall liveHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the Lord GOD and not that he should return from his ways and liveBut when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he dieYet ye say The way of the Lord is not equal Hear now O house of Israel Is not my way equal are not your ways unequalWhen a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he dieAgain when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul aliveBecause he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not dieYet saith the house of Israel The way of the Lord is not equal O house of Israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequalTherefore I will judge you O house of Israel every one according to his ways saith the Lord GOD Repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruinCast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die O house of IsraelFor I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the Lord GOD wherefore turn yourselves and live yeMoreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of IsraelAnd say What is thy mother A lioness she lay down among lions she nourished her whelps among young lionsAnd she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and it learned to catch the prey it devoured menThe nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with chains unto the land of EgyptNow when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lionAnd he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured menAnd he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaringThen the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pitAnd they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king of Babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of IsraelThy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many watersAnd she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branchesBut she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken and withered the fire consumed themAnd now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty groundAnd fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule This is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentationAnd it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD and sat before meThen came the word of the LORD unto me sayingSon of man speak unto the elders of Israel and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Are ye come to inquire of me As I live saith the Lord GOD I will not be inquired of by youWilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathersAnd say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD In the day when I chose Israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt when I lifted up mine hand unto them saying I am the LORD your GodIn the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all landsThen said I unto them Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt I am the LORD your GodBut they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt then I said I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of EgyptBut I wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight I made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of EgyptWherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wildernessAnd I gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in themMoreover also I gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify themBut the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume themBut I wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight I brought them outYet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all landsBecause they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idolsNevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did I make an end of them in the wildernessBut I said unto their children in the wilderness Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor defile yourselves with their idolsI am the LORD your God walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do themAnd hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that I am the LORD your GodNotwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then I said I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wildernessNevertheless I withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in whose sight I brought them forthI lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countriesBecause they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idolsWherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not liveAnd I polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb that I might make them desolate to the end that they might know that I am the LORDTherefore son of man speak unto the house of Israel and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against meFor when I had brought them into the land for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offeringsThen I said unto them What is the high place whereunto ye go And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this dayWherefore say unto the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye whoredom after their abominationsFor when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall I be inquired of by you O house of Israel As I live saith the Lord GOD I will not be inquired of by youAnd that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say We will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stoneAs I live saith the Lord GOD surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will I rule over youAnd I will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured outAnd I will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will I plead with you face to faceLike as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so will I plead with you saith the Lord GODAnd I will cause you to pass under the rod and I will bring you into the bond of the covenantAnd I will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the LORDAs for you O house of Israel thus saith the Lord GOD Go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idolsFor in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of Israel saith the Lord GOD there shall all the house of Israel all of them in the land serve me there will I accept them and there will I require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy thingsI will accept you with your sweet savour when I bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and I will be sanctified in you before the heathenAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD when I shall bring you into the land of Israel into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathersAnd there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committedAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings O ye house of Israel saith the Lord GODMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the south fieldAnd say to the forest of the south Hear the word of the LORD Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned thereinAnd all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it it shall not be quenchedThen said I Ah Lord GOD they say of me Doth he not speak parablesAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face toward Jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of IsraelAnd say to the land of Israel Thus saith the LORD Behold I am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wickedSeeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the northThat all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall not return any moreSigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness sigh before their eyesAnd it shall be when they say unto thee Wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt answer For the tidings because it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and shall be brought to pass saith the Lord GODAgain the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man prophesy and say Thus saith the LORD Say A sword a sword is sharpened and also furbishedIt is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every treeAnd he hath give it to be furbished that it may be handled this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayerCry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it shall be upon all the princes of Israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thighBecause it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the Lord GODThou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which entereth into their privy chambersI have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughterGo thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is setI will also smite mine hands together and I will cause my fury to rest I the LORD have said itThe word of the LORD came unto me again sayingAlso thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of Babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the cityAppoint a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites and to Judah in Jerusalem the defencedFor the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he consulted with images he looked in the liverAt his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fortAnd it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be takenTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because I say that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the handAnd thou profane wicked prince of Israel whose day is come when iniquity shall have an endThus saith the Lord GOD Remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is highI will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and I will give it himAnd thou son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou The sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glitteringWhiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an endShall I cause it to return into his sheath I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativityAnd I will pour out mine indignation upon thee I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men and skilful to destroyThou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for I the LORD have spoken itMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingNow thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city yea thou shalt shew her all her abominationsThen say thou Thus saith the Lord GOD The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against herself to defile herselfThou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countriesThose that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock thee which art infamous and much vexedBehold the princes of Israel every one were in thee to their power to shed bloodIn thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widowThou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my sabbathsIn thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdnessIn thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollutionAnd one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughterIn thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me saith the Lord GODBehold therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of theeCan thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with thee I the LORD have spoken it and will do itAnd I will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of theeAnd thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen and thou shalt know that I am the LORDAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man the house of Israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silverTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye are all become dross behold therefore I will gather you into the midst of JerusalemAs they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury and I will leave you there and melt youYea I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereofAs silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon youAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man say unto her Thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignationThere is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows in the midst thereofHer priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and I am profaned among themHer princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gainAnd her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying Thus saith the Lord GOD when the LORD hath not spokenThe people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfullyAnd I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found noneTherefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have I recompensed upon their heads saith the Lord GODThe word of the LORD came again unto me sayingSon of man there were two women the daughters of one motherAnd they committed whoredoms in Egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginityAnd the names of them were Aholah the elder and Aholibah her sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters Thus were their names Samaria is Aholah and Jerusalem AholibahAnd Aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the Assyrians her neighboursWhich were clothed with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horsesThus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria and with all on whom she doted with all their idols she defiled herselfNeither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon herWherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the Assyrians upon whom she dotedThese discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among women for they had executed judgment upon herAnd when her sister Aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredomsShe doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young menThen I saw that she was defiled that they took both one wayAnd that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilionGirded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea the land of their nativityAnd as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into ChaldeaAnd the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her mind was alienated from themSo she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sisterYet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of EgyptFor she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horsesThus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youthThere O Aholibah thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and I will bring them against thee on every sideThe Babylonians and all the Chaldeans Pekod and Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great lords and renowned all of them riding upon horsesAnd they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about and I will set judgment before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgmentsAnd I will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fireThey shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewelsThus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember Egypt any moreFor thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienatedAnd they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredomsI will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their idolsThou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will I give her cup into thine handThus saith the Lord GOD Thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth muchThou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister SamariaThou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for I have spoken it saith the Lord GODTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredomsThe LORD said moreover unto me Son of man wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah yea declare unto them their abominationsThat they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire to devour themMoreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbathsFor when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of mine houseAnd furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with ornamentsAnd satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oilAnd a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their headsThen said I unto her that was old in adulteries Will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with themYet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah the lewd womenAnd the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their handsFor thus saith the Lord GOD I will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiledAnd the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fireThus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdnessAnd they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that I am the Lord GODAgain in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same dayAnd utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Set on a pot set it on and also pour water into itGather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bonesTake the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it thereinWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall up on itFor her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dustThat it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance I have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be coveredTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Woe to the bloody city I will even make the pile for fire greatHeap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bones be burnedThen set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumedShe hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fireIn thy filthiness is lewdness because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till I have caused my fury to rest upon theeI the LORD have spoken it it shall come to pass and I will do it I will not go back neither will I spare neither will I repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the Lord GODAlso the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man behold I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run downForbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of menSo I spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and I did in the morning as I was commandedAnd the people said unto me Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest soThen I answered them The word of the LORD came unto me sayingSpeak unto the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will profane my sanctuary the excellency of your strength the desire of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the swordAnd ye shall do as I have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of menAnd your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward anotherThus Ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that I am the Lord GODAlso thou son of man shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughtersThat he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine earsIn that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that I am the LORDThe word of the LORD came again unto me sayingSon of man set thy face against the Ammonites and prophesy against themAnd say unto the Ammonites Hear the word of the Lord GOD Thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou saidst Aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of Israel when it was desolate and against the house of Judah when they went into captivityBehold therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milkAnd I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks and ye shall know that I am the LORDFor thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of IsraelBehold therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen and I will cut thee off from the people and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries I will destroy thee and thou shalt know that I am the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Because that Moab and Seir do say Behold the house of Judah is like unto all the heathenTherefore behold I will open the side of Moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country Beth-jeshimoth Baal-meon and KiriathaimUnto the men of the east with the Ammonites and will give them in possession that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nationsAnd I will execute judgments upon Moab and they shall know that I am the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon themTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom and will cut off man and beast from it and I will make it desolate from Teman and they of Dedan shall fall by the swordAnd I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the Lord GODThus saith the Lord GOD Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatredTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines and I will cut off the Cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coastAnd I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that I am the LORD when I shall lay my vengeance upon themAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem Aha she is broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me I shall be replenished now she is laid wasteTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee O Tyrus and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come upAnd they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus and break down her towers I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rockIt shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for I have spoken it saith the Lord GOD and it shall become a spoil to the nationsAnd her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword and they shall know that I am the LORDFor thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon a king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much peopleHe shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and lift up the buckler against theeAnd he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towersBy reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breachWith the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the groundAnd they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waterAnd I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heardAnd I will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for I the LORD have spoken it saith the Lord GODThus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is made in the midst of theeThen all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at theeAnd they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee How art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men the renowned city which wast strong in the sea she and her inhabitants which cause their terror to be on all that haunt itNow shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departureFor thus saith the Lord GOD When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when I shall bring up the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover theeWhen I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the people of old time and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and I shall set glory in the land of the livingI will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the Lord GODThe word of the LORD came again unto me sayingNow thou son of man take up a lamentation for TyrusAnd say unto Tyrus O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant of the people for many isles Thus saith the Lord GOD O Tyrus thou hast said I am of perfect beautyThy borders are in the midst of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beautyThey have made all thy ship

thine heart as the heart of GodBehold thou art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from theeWith thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasuresBy thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy richesTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of GodBehold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightnessThey shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seasWilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee I am God but thou shalt be a man and no God in the hand of him that slayeth theeThou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for I have spoken it saith the Lord GODMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him Thus saith the Lord GOD Thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beautyThou

workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast createdThou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of God thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fireThou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in theeBy the multitude of thy merchandise

the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that I am the LORDAnd there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised them and they shall know that I am the Lord GODThus saith the Lord GOD When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant JacobAnd they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them and they shall know that I am the LORD their GodIn the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all EgyptSpeak and say Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee Pharaoh king of Egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said My river is mine own and I have made it for myselfBut I will put hooks in thy jaws and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scalesAnd I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heavenAnd all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD because they have been a staff of reed to the house of IsraelWhen they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a standTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of theeAnd the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that I am the LORD because he hath said The river is mine and I have made itBehold therefore I am against thee and against thy rivers and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of Syene even unto the border of EthiopiaNo foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty yearsAnd I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countriesYet thus saith the Lord GOD At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scatteredAnd I will bring again the captivity of Egypt and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdomIt shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for I will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nationsAnd it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them but they shall know that I am the Lord GODAnd it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army for Tyrus for the service that he had served against itTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall take her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his armyI have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it because they wrought for me saith the Lord GODIn that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that I am the LORDThe word of the LORD came again unto me sayingSon of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord GOD Howl ye Woe worth the dayFor the day is near even the day of the LORD is near a cloudy day it shall be the time of the heathenAnd the sword shall come upon Egypt and great pain shall be in Ethiopia when the slain shall fall in Egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken downEthiopia and Libya and Lydia and all the mingled people and Chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the swordThus saith the LORD They also that uphold Egypt shall fall and the pride of her power

midst of the cities that are wastedAnd they shall know that I am the LORD when I have set a fire in Egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyedIn that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them as in the day of Egypt for lo it comethThus saith the Lord GOD I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of BabylonHe and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slainAnd I will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and I will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers I the LORD have spoken itThus saith the Lord GOD I will also destroy the idols and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt and I will put a fear in the land of EgyptAnd I will make Pathros desolate and will set fire in Zoan and will execute judgments in NoAnd I will pour my fury upon Sin the strength of Egypt and I will cut off the multitude of NoAnd I will set fire in Egypt Sin shall have great pain and No shall be rent asunder and Noph shall have distresses dailyThe young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword and these cities shall go into captivityAt Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivityThus will I execute judgments in Egypt and they shall know that I am the LORDAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in the seventh day of the month that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a roller to bind it to make it strong to hold the swordTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and I will cause the sword to fall out of his handAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countriesAnd I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand but I will break Pharaohs arms and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded manBut I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that I am the LORD when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of EgyptAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries and they shall know that I am the LORDAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude Whom art thou like in thy greatnessBehold the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughsThe waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the fieldTherefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forthAll the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nationsThus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great watersThe cedars in the garden of God could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beautyI have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied himTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his heightI have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shall surely deal with him I have driven him out for his wickednessAnd strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left himUpon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branchesTo the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pitThus saith the Lord GOD In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning I covered the deep for him and I restrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for himI made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of Eden the choice and best of Lebanon all that drink water shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earthThey also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathenTo whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword This is Pharaoh and all his multitude saith the Lord GODAnd it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first day of the month that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say unto him Thou art like a young lion of the nations and thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thy rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their riversThus saith the Lord GOD I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in my netThen will I leave thee upon the land I will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with theeAnd I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy heightI will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of theeAnd when I shall put thee out I will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her lightAll the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the Lord GODI will also vex the hearts of many people when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not knownYea I will make many people amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when I shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fallFor thus saith the Lord GOD The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon theeBy the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyedI will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble themThen will I make their waters deep and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the Lord GODWhen I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when I shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that I am the LORDThis is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her the daughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for her even for Egypt and for all her multitude saith the Lord GODIt came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man wail for the multitude of Egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pitWhom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcisedThey shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudesThe strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie uncircumcised slain by the swordAsshur is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain fallen by the swordWhose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land of the livingThere is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pitThey have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit he is put in the midst of them that be slainThere is Meshech Tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the livingAnd they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war and they have laid their swords under their heads but their iniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the livingYea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with them that are slain with the swordThere is Edom her kings and all her princes which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pitThere be the princes of the north all of them and all the Zidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror they are ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pitPharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the Lord GODFor I have caused my terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword even Pharaoh and all his multitude saith the Lord GODAgain the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them When I bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their watchmanIf when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the peopleThen whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own headHe heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soulBut if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchmans handSo thou O son of man I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from meWhen I say unto the wicked O wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine handNevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soulTherefore O thou son of man speak unto the house of Israel Thus ye speak saying If our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then liveSay unto them As I live saith the Lord GOD I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die O house of IsraelTherefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinnethWhen I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for itAgain when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and rightIf the wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not dieNone of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely liveYet the children of thy people say The way of the Lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equalWhen the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die therebyBut if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live therebyYet ye say The way of the Lord is not equal O ye house of Israel I will judge you every one after his waysAnd it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me saying The city is smittenNow the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening afore he that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and I was no more dumbThen the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak saying Abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritanceWherefore say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the landYe stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife and shall ye possess the landSay thou thus unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD As I live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilenceFor I will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate that none shall pass throughThen shall they know that I am the LORD when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committedAlso thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying Come I pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORDAnd they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their covetousnessAnd lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them notAnd when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among themAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man prophesy against the shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocksYe eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill them that are fed but ye feed not the flockThe diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled themAnd they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scatteredMy sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and none did search or seek after themTherefore ye shepherds hear the word of the LORDAs I live saith the Lord GOD surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flockTherefore O ye shepherds hear the word of the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against the shepherds and I will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for I will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for themFor thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I even I will both search my sheep and seek them outAs a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark dayAnd I will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the countryI will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of IsraelI will feed my flock and I will cause them to lie down saith the Lord GODI will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but I will destroy the fat and the strong I will feed them with judgmentAnd as for you O my flock thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goatsSeemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the residue with your feetAnd as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feetTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them Behold I even I will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattleBecause ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroadTherefore will I save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and I will judge between cattle and cattleAnd I will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant David he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherdAnd I the LORD will be their God and my servant David a prince among them I the LORD have spoken itAnd I will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woodsAnd I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing and I will cause the shower to come down in his season there shall be showers of blessingAnd the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that I am the LORD when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of themAnd they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afraidAnd I will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of the heathen any moreThus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them and that they even the house of Israel are my people saith the Lord GODAnd ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and I am your God saith the Lord GODMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face against mount Seir and prophesy against itAnd say unto it Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold O mount Seir I am against thee and I will stretch out mine hand against thee and I will make thee most desolateI will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that I am the LORDBecause thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an endTherefore as I live saith the Lord GOD I will prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood even blood shall pursue theeThus will I make mount Seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returnethAnd I will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the swordI will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that I am the LORDBecause thou hast said These two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the LORD was thereTherefore as I live saith the Lord GOD I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them and I will make myself known among them when I have judged theeAnd thou shalt know that I am the LORD and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel saying They are laid desolate they are given us to consumeThus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me I have heard themThus saith the Lord GOD When the whole earth rejoiceth I will make thee desolateAs thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate so will I do unto thee thou shalt be desolate O mount Seir and all Idumea even all of it and they shall know that I am the LORDAlso thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of Israel and say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD Because the enemy hath said against you Aha even the ancient high places are ours in possessionTherefore prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord GOD Because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the peopleTherefore ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord GOD Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round aboutTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all Idumea which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a preyProphesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathenTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD I have lifted up mine hand Surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shameBut ye O mountains of Israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of Israel for they are at hand to comeFor behold I am for you and I will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sownAnd I will multiply men upon you all the house of Israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be buildedAnd I will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and I will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that I am the LORDYea I will cause men to walk upon you even my people Israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of menThus saith the Lord GOD Because they say unto you Thou land devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nationsTherefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the Lord GODNeither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith the Lord GODMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed womanWherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted itAnd I scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings I judged themAnd when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them These are the people of the LORD and are gone forth out of his landBut I had pity for mine holy name which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen whither they wentTherefore say unto the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD I do not this for your sakes O house of Israel but for mine holy names sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye wentAnd I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD saith the Lord GOD when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyesFor I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own landThen will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse youA new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of fleshAnd I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do themAnd ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your GodI will also save you from all your uncleannesses and I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon youAnd I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathenThen shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominationsNot for your sakes do I this saith the Lord GOD be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways O house of IsraelThus saith the Lord GOD In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be buildedAnd the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed byAnd they shall say This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabitedThen the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate I the LORD have spoken it and I will do itThus saith the Lord GOD I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them I will increase them with men like a flockAs the holy flock as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that I am the LORDThe hand of the LORD was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bonesAnd caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dryAnd he said unto me Son of man can these bones live And I answered O Lord GOD thou knowestAgain he said unto me Prophesy upon these bones and say unto them O ye dry bones hear the word of the LORDThus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones Behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall liveAnd I will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the LORDSo I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his boneAnd when I beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in themThen said he unto me Prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind Thus saith the Lord GOD Come from the four winds O breath and breathe upon these slain that they may liveSo I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great armyThen he said unto me Son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say Our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our partsTherefore prophesy and say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold O my people I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of IsraelAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have opened your graves O my people and brought you up out of your gravesAnd shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it and performed it saith the LORDThe word of the LORD came again unto me sayingMoreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it For Judah and for the children of Israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it For Joseph the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companionsAnd join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine handAnd when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by theseSay unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will take the stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of Judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine handAnd the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyesAnd say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own landAnd I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at allNeither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and I will be their GodAnd David my servant shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do themAnd they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein even they and their children and their childrens children for ever and my servant David shall be their prince for everMoreover I will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and I will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermoreMy tabernacle also shall be with them yea I will be their God and they shall be my peopleAnd the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermoreAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingSon of man set thy face against Gog the land of Magog the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal and prophesy against himAnd say Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee O Gog the chief prince of Meshech and TubalAnd I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws and I will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armour even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swordsPersia Ethiopia and Libya with them all of them with shield and helmetGomer and all his bands the house of Togarmah of the north quarters and all his bands and many people with theeBe thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto themAfter many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is gathered out of many people against the mountains of Israel which have been always waste but it is brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell safely all of themThou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with theeThus saith the Lord GOD It shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an evil thoughtAnd thou shalt say I will go up to the land of unwalled villages I will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gatesTo take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the midst of the landSheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee Art thou come to take a spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoilTherefore son of man prophesy and say unto Gog Thus saith the Lord GOD In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not know itAnd thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty armyAnd thou shalt come up against my people of Israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall be in the latter days and I will bring thee against my land that the heathen may know me when I shall be sanctified in thee O Gog before their eyesThus saith the Lord GOD Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against themAnd it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel saith the Lord GOD that my fury shall come up in my faceFor in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of IsraelSo that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the groundAnd I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the Lord GOD every mans sword shall be against his brotherAnd I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and I will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire and brimstoneThus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself and I will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that I am the LORDTherefore thou son of man prophesy against Gog and say Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee O Gog the chief prince of Meshech and TubalAnd I will turn thee back and leave but the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of IsraelAnd I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right handThou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel thou and all thy bands and the people that is with thee I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devouredThou shalt fall upon the open field for I have spoken it saith the Lord GODAnd I will send a fire on Magog and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles and they shall know that I am the LORDSo will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD the Holy One in IsraelBehold it is come and it is done saith the Lord GOD this is the day whereof I have spokenAnd they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall burn them with fire seven yearsSo that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith the Lord GODAnd it shall come to pass in that day that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gogAnd seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the landYea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified saith the Lord GODAnd they shall sever out men of continual employment passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months shall they searchAnd the passengers that pass through the land when any seeth a mans bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gogAnd also the name of the city shall be Hamonah Thus shall they cleanse the landAnd thou son of man thus saith the Lord GOD Speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field Assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel that ye may eat flesh and drink bloodYe shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of BashanAnd ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for youThus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the Lord GODAnd I will set my glory among the heathen and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed and my hand that I have laid upon themSo the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forwardAnd the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me therefore hid I my face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies so fell they all by the swordAccording to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them and hid my face from themTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel and will be jealous for my holy nameAfter that they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them afraidWhen I have brought them again from the people and gathered them out of their enemies lands and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nationsThen shall they know that I am the LORD their God which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen but I have gathered them unto their own land and have left none of them any more thereNeither will I hide my face any more from them for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel saith the Lord GODIn the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning of the year in the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me and brought me

the gate whose prospect is toward the eastSo the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the LORD filled the houseAnd I heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by meAnd he said unto me Son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high placesIn their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore I have consumed them in mine angerNow let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their kings far from me and I will dwell in the midst of them for everThou son of man shew the house to the house of Israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the patternAnd if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the

offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereonAnd thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the Lord GOD a young bullock for a sin offeringAnd thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the settle and upon the border round about thus shalt thou cleanse and purge itThou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house without the sanctuaryAnd on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without

even to the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD O ye house of Israel let it suffice you of all your abominationsIn that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominationsAnd ye have not

thirty broad these four corners were of one measureAnd there was a row of building round about in them round about them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round aboutThen said he unto me These are the places of them that boil where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the peopleAfterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altarThen brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right sideAnd when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the anclesAgain he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees Again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loinsAfterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed overAnd he said unto me Son of man hast thou seen this Then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the riverNow when I had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the otherThen said he unto me These waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healedAnd it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river comethAnd it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim they shall be a place to spread forth nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding manyBut the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to saltAnd by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and

Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged itAnd the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his godAnd the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the kings seed and of the princesChildren in whom was no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the ChaldeansAnd the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the kingNow among these were of the children of Judah Daniel Hananiah Mishael and AzariahUnto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar and to Hananiah of Shadrach and to Mishael of Meshach and to Azariah of Abed-negoBut Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himselfNow God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchsAnd the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the kingThen said Daniel to Melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel Hananiah Mishael and AzariahProve thy servants I beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drinkThen let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings meat and as thou seest deal with thy servantsSo he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten daysAnd at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the kings meatThus Melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulseAs for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreamsNow at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before NebuchadnezzarAnd the king communed with them and among them all was found none like Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah therefore stood they before the kingAnd in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realmAnd Daniel continued even unto the first year of king CyrusAnd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep brake from himThen the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams So they came and stood before the kingAnd the king said unto them I have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dreamThen spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack O king live for ever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the interpretationThe king answered and said to the Chaldeans The thing is gone from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghillBut if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereofThey answered again and said Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation of itThe king answered and said I know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from meBut if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereofThe Chaldeans answered before the king and said There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there is no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or astrologer or ChaldeanAnd it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with fleshFor this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of BabylonAnd the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slainThen Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of BabylonHe answered and said to Arioch the kings captain Why is the decree so hasty from the king Then Arioch made the thing known to DanielThen Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretationThen Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah Mishael and Azariah his companionsThat they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of BabylonThen was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision Then Daniel blessed the God of heavenDaniel answered and said Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and might are hisAnd he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understandingHe revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with himI thank thee and praise thee O thou God of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings matterTherefore Daniel went in unto Arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon he went and said thus unto him Destroy not the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the king and I will shew unto the king the interpretationThen Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretationThe king answered and said to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation thereofDaniel answered in the presence of the king and said The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the soothsayers shew unto the kingBut there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are theseAs for thee O king thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to passBut as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heartThou O king sawest and behold a great image This great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terribleThis images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brassHis legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clayThou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to piecesThen was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earthThis is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the kingThou O king art a king of kings for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and gloryAnd wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all Thou art this head of goldAnd after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earthAnd the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruiseAnd whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clayAnd as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brokenAnd whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clayAnd in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for everForasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sureThen the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto himThe king answered unto Daniel and said Of a truth it is that your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secretThen the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of BabylonThen Daniel requested of the king and he set Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon but Daniel sat in the gate of the kingNebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of BabylonThen Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counsellers the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set upThen the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellers the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set upThen an herald cried aloud To you it is commanded O people nations and languagesThat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set upAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnaceTherefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set upWherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the JewsThey spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar O king live for everThou O king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden imageAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnaceThere are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego these men O king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set upThen Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego Then they brought these men before the kingNebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them Is it true O Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set upNow if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image which I have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my handsShadrach Meshach and Abed-nego answered and said to the king O Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matterIf it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O kingBut if not be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set upThen was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heatedAnd he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnaceThen these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnaceTherefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abed-negoAnd these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnaceThen Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counsellers Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire They answered and said unto the king True O kingHe answered and said Lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of GodThen Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego ye servants of the most high God come forth and come hither Then Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego came forth of the midst of the fireAnd the princes governors and captains and the kings counsellers being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on themThen Nebuchadnezzar spake and said Blessed be the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own GodTherefore I make a decree That every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sortThen the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abed-nego in the province of BabylonNebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth Peace be multiplied unto youI thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward meHow great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generationI Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palaceI saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled meTherefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dreamThen came in the magicians the astrologers the Chaldeans and the soothsayers and I told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereofBut at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was Belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and before him I told the dream sayingO Belteshazzar master of the magicians because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation thereofThus were the visions of mine head in my bed I saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was greatThe tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earthThe leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed of itI saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heavenHe cried aloud and said thus Hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from his branchesNevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earthLet his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over himThis matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of menThis dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen Now thou O Belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is in theeThen Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar was astonied for one hour and his thoughts troubled him The king spake and said Belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee Belteshazzar answered and said My lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemiesThe tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earthWhose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitationIt is thou O king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earthAnd whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven and saying Hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over himThis is the interpretation O king and this is the decree of the most High which is come upon my lord the kingThat they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he willAnd whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do ruleWherefore O king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillityAll this came upon the king NebuchadnezzarAt the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of BabylonThe king spake and said Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majestyWhile the word was in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying O king Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken The kingdom is departed from theeAnd they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he willThe same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds clawsAnd at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and I blessed the most High and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generationAnd all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him What doest thouAt the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour and brightness returned unto me and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me and I was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto meNow I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abaseBelshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousandBelshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink thereinThen they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives and his concubines drank in themThey drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stoneIn the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the kings palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wroteThen the kings countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against anotherThe king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the Chaldeans and the soothsayers And the king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon Whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdomThen came in all the kings wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereofThen was king Belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astoniedNow the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said O king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changedThere is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father the king I say thy father made master of the magicians astrologers Chaldeans and soothsayersForasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar now let Daniel be called and he will shew the interpretationThen was Daniel brought in before the king And the king spake and said unto Daniel Art thou that Daniel which art of the children of the captivity of Judah whom the king my father brought out of JewryI have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in theeAnd now the wise men the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretation of the thingAnd I have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdomThen Daniel answered and said before the king Let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet I will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretationO thou king the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honourAnd for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put downBut when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from himAnd he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he willAnd thou his son O Belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all thisBut hast lifted up thyself against the LORD of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the God in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorifiedThen was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was writtenAnd this is the writing that was written MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSINThis is the interpretation of the thing MENE God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished itTEKEL Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wantingPERES Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and PersiansThen commanded Belshazzar and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdomIn that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slainAnd Darius the Median took the kingdom being about threescore and two years oldIt pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdomAnd over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damageThen this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realmThen the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in himThen said these men We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his GodThen these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live for everAll the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the counsellers and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days save of thee O king he shall be cast into the den of lionsNow O king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth notWherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decreeNow when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did aforetimeThen these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his GodThen they came near and spake before the king concerning the kings decree Hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days save of thee O king shall be cast into the den of lions The king answered and said The thing is true according to the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth notThen answered they and said before the king That Daniel which is of the children of the captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a dayThen the king when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver himThen these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king Know O king that the law of the Medes and Persians is That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changedThen the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions Now the king spake and said unto Daniel Thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver theeAnd a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning DanielThen the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep went from himThen the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lionsAnd when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the king spake and said to Daniel O Daniel servant of the living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lionsThen said Daniel unto the king O king live for everMy God hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee O king have I done no hurtThen was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his GodAnd the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused Daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the denThen king Darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth Peace be multiplied unto youI make a decree That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel for he is the living God and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the endHe delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lionsSo this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the PersianIn the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the mattersDaniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great seaAnd four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from anotherThe first was like a lion and had eagles wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to itAnd behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it Arise devour much fleshAfter this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to itAfter this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten hornsI considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great thingsI beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fireA fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were openedI beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flameAs concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and timeI saw in the night visions and behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of days and they brought him near before himAnd there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyedI Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled meI came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the thingsThese great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earthBut the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and everThen I would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with his feetAnd of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look was more stout than his fellowsI beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against themUntil the Ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most High and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdomThus he said The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in piecesAnd the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kingsAnd he shall speak great words against the most High and shall wear out the saints of the most High and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of timeBut the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the endAnd the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey himHitherto is the end of the matter As for me Daniel my cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but I kept the matter in my heartIn the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me Daniel after that which appeared unto me at the firstAnd I saw in a vision and it came to pass when I saw that I was at Shushan in the palace which is in the province of Elam and I saw in a vision and I was by the river of UlaiThen I lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up lastI saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became greatAnd as I was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyesAnd he came to the ram that had two horns which I had there seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his powerAnd I saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his handTherefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heavenAnd out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant landAnd it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon themYea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of his sanctuary was cast downAnd an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prosperedThen I heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under footAnd he said unto me Unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansedAnd it came to pass when I even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a manAnd I heard a mans voice between the banks of Ulai which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the visionSo he came near where I stood and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me Understand O son of man for at the time of the end shall be the visionNow as he was speaking with me I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me uprightAnd he said Behold I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall beThe ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and PersiaAnd the rough goat is the king of Grecia and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first kingNow that being broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his powerAnd in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand upAnd his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy peopleAnd through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes but he shall be broken without handAnd the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many daysAnd I Daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward I rose up and did the kings business and I was astonished at the vision but none understood itIn the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus of the seed of the Medes which was made king over the realm of the ChaldeansIn the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of JerusalemAnd I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashesAnd I prayed unto the LORD my God and made my confession and said O Lord the great and dreadful God keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandmentsWe have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgmentsNeither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the landO Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against theeO Lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against theeTo the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against himNeither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophetsYea all Israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against himAnd he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon JerusalemAs it is written in the law of Moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truthTherefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth for we obeyed not his voiceAnd now O Lord our God that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedlyO Lord according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about usNow therefore O our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the Lords sakeO my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great merciesO Lord hear O Lord forgive O Lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake O my God for thy city and thy people are called by thy nameAnd whiles I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my GodYea whiles I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblationAnd he informed me and talked with me and said O Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understandingAt the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and I am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the visionSeventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most HolyKnow therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous timesAnd after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determinedAnd he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolateIn the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called Belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the visionIn those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeksI ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilledAnd in the four and twentieth day of the first month as I was by the side of the great river which is HiddekelThen I lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of UphazHis body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitudeAnd I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselvesTherefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and I retained no strengthYet heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of his words then was I in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the groundAnd behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my handsAnd he said unto me O Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am I now sent And when he had spoken this word unto me I stood tremblingThen said he unto me Fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy wordsBut the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of PersiaNow I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many daysAnd when he had spoken such words unto me I set my face toward the ground and I became dumbAnd behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips then I opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me O my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and I have retained no strengthFor how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither is there breath left in meThen there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened meAnd said O man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong And when he had spoken unto me I was strengthened and said Let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened meThen said he Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia and when I am gone forth lo the prince of Grecia shall comeBut I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but Michael your princeAlso I in the first year of Darius the Mede even I stood to confirm and to strengthen himAnd now will I shew thee the truth Behold there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia and the fourth shall be far richer than they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of GreciaAnd a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his willAnd when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside thoseAnd the king of the south shall be strong and one of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominionAnd in the end of years they shall join themselves together for the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in these timesBut out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevailAnd shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the northSo the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall return into his own landBut his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and pass through then shall he return and be stirred up even to his fortressAnd the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given into his handAnd when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall not be strengthened by itFor the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much richesAnd in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision but they shall fallSo the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any strength to withstandBut he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the glorious land which by his hand shall be consumedHe shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shall not stand on his side neither be for himAfter this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon himThen he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and not be foundThen shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battleAnd in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteriesAnd with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenantAnd after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small peopleHe shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds even for a timeAnd he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall not stand for they shall forecast devices against himYea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slainAnd both these kings hearts shall be to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet the end shall be at the time appointedThen shall he return into his land with great riches and his heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits and return to his own landAt the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south but it shall not be as the former or as the latterFor the ships of Chittim shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenantAnd arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolateAnd such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploitsAnd they that understand among the people shall instruct many yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by spoil many daysNow when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help but many shall cleave to them with flatteriesAnd some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge and to make them white even to the time of the end because it is yet for a time appointedAnd the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that that is determined shall be doneNeither shall he regard the God of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above allBut in his estate shall he honour the God of forces and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant thingsThus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gainAnd at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass overHe shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of AmmonHe shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of Egypt shall not escapeBut he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his stepsBut tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away manyAnd he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help himAnd at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the bookAnd many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contemptAnd they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and everBut thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increasedThen I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the riverAnd one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river How long shall it be to the end of these wondersAnd I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finishedAnd I heard but I understood not then said I O my Lord what shall be the end of these thingsAnd he said Go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the endMany shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understandAnd from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety daysBlessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty daysBut go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the daysThe word of the LORD that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of IsraelThe beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea And the LORD said to Hosea Go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the LORDSo he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim which conceived and bare him a sonAnd the LORD said unto him Call his name Jezreel for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of IsraelAnd it shall come to pass at that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of JezreelAnd she conceived again and bare a daughter And God said unto him Call her name Lo-ruhamah for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel but I will utterly take them awayBut I will have mercy upon the house of Judah and will save them by the LORD their God and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by horsemenNow when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah she conceived and bare a sonThen said God Call his name Lo-ammi for ye are not my people and I will not be your GodYet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them Ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them Ye are the sons of the living GodThen shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of JezreelSay ye unto your brethren Ammi and to your sisters Ru-hamahPlead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am I her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries from between her breastsLest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirstAnd I will not have mercy upon her children for they be the children of whoredomsFor their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them hath done shamefully for she said I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my drinkTherefore behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her pathsAnd she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say I will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than nowFor she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for BaalTherefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakednessAnd now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers and none shall deliver her out of mine handI will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn feastsAnd I will destroy her vines and her fig trees whereof she hath said These are my rewards that my lovers have given me and I will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat themAnd I will visit upon her the days of Baalim wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the LORDTherefore behold I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto herAnd I will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of Achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of EgyptAnd it shall be at that day saith the LORD that thou shalt call me Ishi and shalt call me no more BaaliFor I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their nameAnd in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safelyAnd I will betroth thee unto me for ever yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness and in merciesI will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the LORDAnd it shall come to pass in that day I will hear saith the LORD I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earthAnd the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear JezreelAnd I will sow her unto me in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people Thou art my people and they shall say Thou art my GodThen said the LORD unto me Go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wineSo I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for an homer of barley and an half homer of barleyAnd I said unto her Thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will I also be for theeFor the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without teraphimAfterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the LORD their God and David their king and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter daysHear the word of the LORD ye children of Israel for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of God in the landBy swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth bloodTherefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken awayYet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people are as they that strive with the priestTherefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night and I will destroy thy motherMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God I will also forget thy childrenAs they were increased so they sinned against me therefore will I change their glory into shameThey eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on their iniquityAnd there shall be like people like priest and I will punish them for their ways and reward them their doingsFor they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to take heed to the LORDWhoredom and wine and new wine take away the heartMy people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err and they have gone a whoring from under their GodThey sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadow thereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom and your spouses shall commit adulteryI will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom nor your spouses when they commit adultery for themselves are separated with whores and they sacrifice with harlots therefore the people that doth not understand shall fallThough thou Israel play the harlot yet let not Judah offend and come not ye unto Gilgal neither go ye up to Beth-aven nor swear The LORD livethFor Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large placeEphraim is joined to idols let him aloneTheir drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually her rulers with shame do love Give yeThe wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrificesHear ye this O priests and hearken ye house of Israel and give ye ear O house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye have been a snare on Mizpah and a net spread upon TaborAnd the revolters are profound to make slaughter though I have been a rebuker of them allI know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me for now O Ephraim thou committest whoredom and Israel is defiledThey will not frame their doings to turn unto their God for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the LORDAnd the pride of Israel doth testify to his face therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity Judah also shall fall with themThey shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from themThey have dealt treacherously against the LORD for they have begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their portionsBlow ye the cornet in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah cry aloud at Beth-aven after thee O BenjaminEphraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely beThe princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like waterEphraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly walked after the commandmentTherefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth and to the house of Judah as rottennessWhen Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound then went Ephraim to the Assyrian and sent to king Jareb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your woundFor I will be unto Ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of Judah I even I will tear and go away I will take away and none shall rescue himI will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me earlyCome and let us return unto the LORD for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us upAfter two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sightThen shall we know if we follow on to know the LORD his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earthO Ephraim what shall I do unto thee O Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew it goeth awayTherefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forthFor I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offeringsBut they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against meGilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with bloodAnd as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdnessI have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel there is the whoredom of Ephraim Israel is defiledAlso O Judah he hath set an harvest for thee when I returned the captivity of my peopleWhen I would have healed Israel then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered and the wickedness of Samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth withoutAnd they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are before my faceThey make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their liesThey are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough until it be leavenedIn the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine he stretched out his hand with scornersFor they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fireThey are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto meEphraim he hath mixed himself among the people Ephraim is a cake not turnedStrangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yea gray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth notAnd the pride of Israel testifieth to his face and they do not return to the LORD their God nor seek him for all thisEphraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to Egypt they go to AssyriaWhen they shall go I will spread my net upon them I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven I will chastise them as their congregation hath heardWoe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto them because they have transgressed against me though I have redeemed them yet they have spoken lies against meAnd they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against meThough I have bound and strengthened their arms yet do they imagine mischief against meThey return but not to the most High they are like a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of EgyptSet the trumpet to thy mouth He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD because they have transgressed my covenant and trespassed against my lawIsrael shall cry unto me My God we know theeIsrael hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue himThey have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and I knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them idols that they may be cut offThy calf O Samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindled against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocencyFor from Israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is not God but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in piecesFor they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the strangers shall swallow it upIsrael is swallowed up now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasureFor they are gone up to Assyria a wild ass alone by himself Ephraim hath hired loversYea though they have hired among the nations now will I gather them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princesBecause Ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall be unto him to sinI have written to him the great things of my law but they were counted as a strange thingThey sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings and eat it but the LORD accepteth them not now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to EgyptFor Israel hath forgotten his Maker and buildeth temples and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities but I will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour the palaces thereofRejoice not O Israel for joy as other people for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloorThe floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail in herThey shall not dwell in the LORDs land but Ephraim shall return to Egypt and they shall eat unclean things in AssyriaThey shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD neither shall they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORDWhat will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of the LORDFor lo they are gone because of destruction Egypt shall gather them up Memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their tabernaclesThe days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come Israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatredThe watchman of Ephraim was with my God but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his GodThey have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sinsI found Israel like grapes in the wilderness I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to Baal-peor and separated themselves unto that shame and their abominations were according as they lovedAs for Ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the birth and from the womb and from the conceptionThough they bring up their children yet will I bereave them that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when I depart from themEphraim as I saw Tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murdererGive them O LORD what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breastsAll their wickedness is in Gilgal for there I hated them for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house I will love them no more all their princes are revoltersEphraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their wombMy God will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nationsIsrael is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly imagesTheir heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall break down their altars he shall spoil their imagesFor now they shall say We have no king because we feared not the LORD what then should a king do to usThey have spoken words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the fieldThe inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from itIt shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb Ephraim shall receive shame and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counselAs for Samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the waterThe high places also of Aven the sin of Israel shall be destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains Cover us and to the hills Fall on usO Israel thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah there they stood the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake themIt is in my desire that I should chastise them and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrowsAnd Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn but I passed over upon her fair neck I will make Ephraim to ride Judah shall plow and Jacob shall break his clodsSow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the LORD till he come and rain righteousness upon youYe have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty menTherefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her childrenSo shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut offWhen Israel was a child then I loved him and called my son out of EgyptAs they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto Baalim and burned incense to graven imagesI taught Ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that I healed themI drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and I laid meat unto themHe shall not return into the land of Egypt but the Assyrian shall be his king because they refused to returnAnd the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his branches and devour them because of their own counselsAnd my people are bent to backsliding from me though they called them to the most High none at all would exalt himHow shall I give thee up Ephraim how shall I deliver thee Israel how shall I make thee as Admah how shall I set thee as Zeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindled togetherI will not execute the fierceness of mine anger I will not return to destroy Ephraim for I am God and not man the Holy One in the midst of thee and I will not enter into the cityThey shall walk after the LORD he shall roar like a lion when he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the westThey shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt and as a dove out of the land of Assyria and I will place them in their houses saith the LORDEphraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of Israel with deceit but Judah yet ruleth with God and is faithful with the saintsEphraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he daily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians and oil is carried into EgyptThe LORD hath also a controversy with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he recompense himHe took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with GodYea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in Bethel and there he spake with usEven the LORD God of hosts the LORD is his memorialTherefore turn thou to thy God keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continuallyHe is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppressAnd Ephraim said Yet I am become rich I have found me out substance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sinAnd I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feastI have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophetsIs there iniquity in Gilead surely they are vanity they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fieldsAnd Jacob fled into the country of Syria and Israel served for a wife and for a wife he kept sheepAnd by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet was he preservedEphraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his Lord return unto himWhen Ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in Israel but when he offended in Baal he diedAnd now they sin more and more and have made them molten images of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calvesTherefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimneyYet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt know no god but me for there is no saviour beside meI did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great droughtAccording to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten meTherefore I will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way will I observe themI will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will I devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear themO Israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine helpI will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst Give me a king and princesI gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in my wrathThe iniquity of Ephraim is bound up his sin is hidThe sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of childrenI will ransom them from the power of the grave I will redeem them from death O death I will be thy plagues O grave I will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyesThough he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall come the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness and his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vesselsSamaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her God they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped upO Israel return unto the LORD thy God for thou hast fallen by thine iniquityTake with you words and turn to the LORD say unto him Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we render the calves of our lipsAsshur shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands Ye are our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercyI will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from himI will be as the dew unto Israel he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as LebanonHis branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as LebanonThey that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the wine of LebanonEphraim shall say What have I to do any more with idols I have heard him and observed him I am like a green fir tree From me is thy fruit foundWho is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and he shall know them for the ways of the LORD are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall thereinThe word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of PethuelHear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land Hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathersTell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generationThat which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eatenAwake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouthFor a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lionHe hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made whiteLament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youthThe meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD the priests the LORDs ministers mournThe field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languishethBe ye ashamed O ye husbandmen howl O ye vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perishedThe vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of menGird yourselves and lament ye priests howl ye ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth ye ministers of my God for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your GodSanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God and cry unto the LORDAlas for the day for the day of the LORD is at hand and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it comeIs not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of our GodThe seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is witheredHow do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolateO LORD to thee will I cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the fieldThe beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wildernessBlow ye the trumpet in Zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the LORD cometh for it is nigh at handA day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the years of many generationsA fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing shall escape themThe appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so shall they runLike the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle arrayBefore their face the people shall be much pained all faces shall gather blacknessThey shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men of war and they shall march every one on his ways and they shall not break their ranksNeither shall one thrust another they shall walk every one in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be woundedThey shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon the houses they shall enter in at the windows like a thiefThe earth shall quake before them the heavens shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark and the stars shall withdraw their shiningAnd the LORD shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible and who can abide itTherefore also now saith the LORD turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourningAnd rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the LORD your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evilWho knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your GodBlow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assemblyGather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closetLet the priests the ministers of the LORD weep between the porch and the altar and let them say Spare thy people O LORD and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people Where is their GodThen will the LORD be jealous for his land and pity his peopleYea the LORD will answer and say unto his people Behold I will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathenBut I will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great thingsFear not O land be glad and rejoice for the LORD will do great thingsBe not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strengthBe glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the LORD your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first monthAnd the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oilAnd I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army which I sent among youAnd ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the LORD your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamedAnd ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the LORD your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamedAnd it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visionsAnd also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spiritAnd I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smokeThe sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the LORD comeAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the LORD hath said and in the remnant whom the LORD shall callFor behold in those days and in that time when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and JerusalemI will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my landAnd they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for an harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drinkYea and what have ye to do with me O Tyre and Zidon and all the coasts of Palestine will ye render me a recompence and if ye recompence me swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own headBecause ye have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant thingsThe children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians that ye might remove them far from their borderBehold I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them and will return your recompence upon your own headAnd I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah and they shall sell them to the Sabeans to a people far off for the LORD hath spoken itProclaim ye this among the Gentiles Prepare war wake up the mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come upBeat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears let the weak say I am strongAssemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come down O LORDLet the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round aboutPut ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is greatMultitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decisionThe sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall withdraw their shiningThe LORD also shall roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the LORD will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of IsraelSo shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion my holy mountain then shall Jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any moreAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD and shall water the valley of ShittimEgypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the violence against the children of Judah because they have shed innocent blood in their landBut Judah shall dwell for ever and Jerusalem from generation to generationFor I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed for the LORD dwelleth in ZionThe words of Amos who was among the herdman of Tekoa which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel two years before the earthquakeAnd he said The LORD will roar from Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn and the top of Carmel shall witherThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of ironBut I will send a fire into the house of Hazael which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadadI will break also the bar of Damascus and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir saith the LORDThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Gaza and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to EdomBut I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza which shall devour the palaces thereofAnd I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon and I will turn mine hand against Ekron and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish saith the Lord GODThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Tyrus and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom and remembered not the brotherly covenantBut I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus which shall devour the palaces thereofThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for everBut I will send a fire upon Teman which shall devour the palaces of BozrahThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of the children of Ammon and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead that they might enlarge their borderBut I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah and it shall devour the palaces thereof with shouting in the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwindAnd their king shall go into captivity he and his princes together saith the LORDThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into limeBut I will send a fire upon Moab and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth and Moab shall die with tumult with shouting and with the sound of the trumpetAnd I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all the princes thereof with him saith the LORDThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have despised the law of the LORD and have not kept his commandments and their lies caused them to err after the which their fathers have walkedBut I will send a fire upon Judah and it shall devour the palaces of JerusalemThus saith the LORD For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoesThat pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn aside the way of the meek and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid to profane my holy nameAnd they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their godYet destroyed I the Amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneathAlso I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the AmoriteAnd I raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men for Nazarites Is it not even thus O ye children of Israel saith the LORDBut ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink and commanded the prophets saying Prophesy notBehold I am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full of sheavesTherefore the flight shall perish from the swift and the strong shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver himselfNeither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himselfAnd he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day saith the LORDHear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you O children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt sayingYou only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquitiesCan two walk together except they be agreedWill a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothingCan a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at allShall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the LORD hath not done itSurely the Lord GOD will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophetsThe lion hath roared who will not fear the Lord GOD hath spoken who can but prophesyPublish in the palaces at Ashdod and in the palaces in the land of Egypt and say Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereofFor they know not to do right saith the LORD who store up violence and robbery in their palacesTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD An adversary there shall be even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces shall be spoiledThus saith the LORD As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed and in Damascus in a couchHear ye and testify in the house of Jacob saith the Lord GOD the God of hostsThat in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the groundAnd I will smite the winter house with the summer house and the houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end saith the LORDHear this word ye kine of Bashan that are in the mountain of Samaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say to their masters Bring and let us drinkThe Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your posterity with fishhooksAnd ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the LORDCome to Bethel and transgress at Gilgal multiply transgression and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three yearsAnd offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven and proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you O ye children of Israel saith the Lord GODAnd I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORDAnd also I have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest and I caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the piece whereupon it rained not witheredSo two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORDI have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the palmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORDI have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt your young men have I slain with the sword and have taken away your horses and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORDI have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORDTherefore thus will I do unto thee O Israel and because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God O IsraelFor lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth The LORD The God of hosts is his nameHear ye this word which I take up against you even a lamentation O house of IsraelThe virgin of Israel is fallen she shall no more rise she is forsaken upon her land there is none to raise her upFor thus saith the Lord GOD The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten to the house of IsraelFor thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel Seek ye me and ye shall liveBut seek not Bethel nor enter into Gilgal and pass not to Beer-sheba for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity and Bethel shall come to noughtSeek the LORD and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in BethelYe who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in the earthSeek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth The LORD is his nameThat strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortressThey hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that speaketh uprightlyForasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and ye take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of themFor I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their rightTherefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil timeSeek good and not evil that ye may live and so the LORD the God of hosts shall be with you as ye have spokenHate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of JosephTherefore the LORD the God of hosts the Lord saith thus Wailing shall be in all streets and they shall say in all the highways Alas alas and they shall call the husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailingAnd in all vineyards shall be wailing for I will pass through thee saith the LORDWoe unto you that desire the day of the LORD to what end is it for you the day of the LORD is darkness and not lightAs if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit himShall not the day of the LORD be darkness and not light even very dark and no brightness in itI hate I despise your feast days and I will not smell in your solemn assembliesThough ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings I will not accept them neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beastsTake thou away from me the noise of thy songs for I will not hear the melody of thy violsBut let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty streamHave ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years O house of IsraelBut ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselvesTherefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus saith the LORD whose name is The God of hostsWoe to them that are at ease in Zion and trust in the mountain of Samaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house of Israel camePass ye unto Calneh and see and from thence go ye to Hamath the great then go down to Gath of the Philistines be they better than these kingdoms or their border greater than your borderYe that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence to come nearThat lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stallThat chant to the sound of the viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like DavidThat drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of JosephTherefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removedThe Lord GOD hath sworn by himself saith the LORD the God of hosts I abhor the excellency of Jacob and hate his palaces therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is thereinAnd it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house that they shall dieAnd a mans uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him to bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house Is there yet any with thee and he shall say No Then shall he say Hold thy tongue for we may not make mention of the name of the LORDFor behold the LORD commandeth and he will smite the great house with breaches and the little house with cleftsShall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxen for ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness into hemlockYe which rejoice in a thing of nought which say Have we not taken to us horns by our own strengthBut behold I will raise up against you a nation O house of Israel saith the LORD the God of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wildernessThus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me and behold he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth and lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowingsAnd it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land then I said O Lord GOD forgive I beseech thee by whom shall Jacob arise for he is smallThe LORD repented for this It shall not be saith the LORDThus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me and behold the Lord GOD called to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eat up a partThen said I O Lord GOD cease I beseech thee by whom shall Jacob arise for he is smallThe LORD repented for this This also shall not be saith the Lord GODThus he shewed me and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline with a plumbline in his handAnd the LORD said unto me Amos what seest thou And I said A plumbline Then said the Lord Behold I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel I will not again pass by them any moreAnd the high places of Isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the swordThen Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel the land is not able to bear all his wordsFor thus Amos saith Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own landAlso Amaziah said unto Amos O thou seer go flee thee away into the land of Judah and there eat bread and prophesy thereBut prophesy not again any more at Bethel for it is the kings chapel and it is the kings courtThen answered Amos and said to Amaziah I was no prophet neither was I a prophets son but I was an herdman and a gatherer of sycomore fruitAnd the LORD took me as I followed the flock and the LORD said unto me Go prophesy unto my people IsraelNow therefore hear thou the word of the LORD Thou sayest Prophesy not against Israel and drop not thy word against the house of IsaacTherefore thus saith the LORD Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his landThus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me and behold a basket of summer fruitAnd he said Amos what seest thou And I said A basket of summer fruit Then said the LORD unto me The end is come upon my people of Israel I will not again pass by them any moreAnd the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saith the Lord GOD there shall be many dead bodies in every place they shall cast them forth with silenceHear this O ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to failSaying When will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceitThat we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheatThe LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob Surely I will never forget any of their worksShall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shall be cast out and drowned as by the flood of EgyptAnd it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord GOD that I will cause the sun to go down at noon and I will darken the earth in the clear dayAnd I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and I will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter dayBehold the days come saith the Lord GOD that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the LORDAnd they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD and shall not find itIn that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirstThey that swear by the sin of Samaria and say Thy god O Dan liveth and The manner of Beer-sheba liveth even they shall fall and never rise up againI saw the LORD standing upon the altar and he said Smite the lintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in the head all of them and I will slay the last of them with the sword he that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them shall not be deliveredThough they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will I bring them downAnd though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel I will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will I command the serpent and he shall bite themAnd though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will I command the sword and it shall slay them and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for goodAnd the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land and it shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood of EgyptIt is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth The LORD is his nameAre ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me O children of Israel saith the LORD Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from KirBehold the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob saith the LORDFor lo I will command and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earthAll the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say The evil shall not overtake nor prevent usIn that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and I will raise up his ruins and I will build it as in the days of oldThat they may possess the remnant of Edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the LORD that doeth thisBehold the days come saith the LORD that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall meltAnd I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of themAnd I will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them saith the LORD thy GodThe vision of Obadiah Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom We have heard a rumour from the LORD and an ambassador is sent among the heathen Arise ye and let us rise up against her in battleBehold I have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despisedThe pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart Who shall bring me down to the groundThough thou exalt thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars thence will I bring thee down saith the LORDIf thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut off would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapesHow are the things of Esau searched out how are his hidden things sought upAll the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in himShall I not in that day saith the LORD even destroy the wise men out of Edom and understanding out of the mount of EsauAnd thy mighty men O Teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughterFor thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for everIn the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem even thou wast as one of themBut thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distressThou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamityNeither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distressFor the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own headFor as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain so shall all the heathen drink continually yea they shall drink and they shall swallow down and they shall be as though they had not beenBut upon mount Zion shall be deliverance and there shall be holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessionsAnd the house of Jacob shall be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame and the house of Esau for stubble and they shall kindle in them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau for the LORD hath spoken itAnd they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau and they of the plain the Philistines and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria and Benjamin shall possess GileadAnd the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites even unto Zarephath and the captivity of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the southAnd saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau and the kingdom shall be the LORDsNow the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai sayingArise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before meBut Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to Tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORDBut the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be brokenThen the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleepSo the shipmaster came to him and said unto him What meanest thou O sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish notAnd they said every one to his fellow Come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us So they cast lots and the lot fell upon JonahThen said they unto him Tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us What is thine occupation and whence comest thou what is thy country and of what people art thouAnd he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the LORD the God of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry landThen were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him Why hast thou done this For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD because he had told themThen said they unto him What shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuousAnd he said unto them Take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon youNevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but they could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against themWherefore they cried unto the LORD and said We beseech thee O LORD we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood for thou O LORD hast done as it pleased theeSo they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her ragingThen the men feared the LORD exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD and made vowsNow the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nightsThen Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fishs bellyAnd said I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried I and thou heardest my voiceFor thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over meThen I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy holy templeThe waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my headI went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption O LORD my GodWhen my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy templeThey that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercyBut I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed Salvation is of the LORDAnd the LORD spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry landAnd the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time sayingArise go unto Nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that I bid theeSo Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh according to the word of the LORD Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journeyAnd Jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he cried and said Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrownSo the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of themFor word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashesAnd he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles saying Let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drink waterBut let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their handsWho can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish notAnd God saw their works that they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it notBut it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angryAnd he prayed unto the LORD and said I pray thee O LORD was not this my saying when I was yet in my country Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee of the evilTherefore now O LORD take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to liveThen said the LORD Doest thou well to be angrySo Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the cityAnd the LORD God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourdBut God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smote the gourd that it witheredAnd it came to pass when the sun did arise that God prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said It is better for me to die than to liveAnd God said to Jonah Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd And he said I do well to be angry even unto deathThen said the LORD Thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a nightAnd should not I spare Nineveh that great city wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattleThe word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah which he saw concerning Samaria and JerusalemHear all ye people hearken O earth and all that therein is and let the Lord GOD be witness against you the Lord from his holy templeFor behold the LORD cometh forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earthAnd the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured down a steep placeFor the transgression of Jacob is all this and for the sins of the house of Israel What is the transgression of Jacob is it not Samaria and what are the high places of Judah are they not JerusalemTherefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field and as plantings of a vineyard and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley and I will discover the foundations thereofAnd all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlotTherefore I will wail and howl I will go stripped and naked I will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owlsFor her wound is incurable for it is come unto Judah he is come unto the gate of my people even to JerusalemDeclare ye it not at Gath weep ye not at all in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dustPass ye away thou inhabitant of Saphir having thy shame naked the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel he shall receive of you his standingFor the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of JerusalemO thou inhabitant of Lachish bind the chariot to the swift beast she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion for the transgressions of Israel were found in theeTherefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of IsraelYet will I bring an heir unto thee O inhabitant of Mareshah he shall come unto Adullam the glory of IsraelMake thee bald and poll thee for thy delicate children enlarge thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from theeWoe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their handAnd they covet fields and take them by violence and houses and take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritageTherefore thus saith the LORD Behold against this family do I devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evilIn that day shall one take up a parable against you and lament with a doleful lamentation and say We be utterly spoiled he hath changed the portion of my people how hath he removed it from me turning away he hath divided our fieldsTherefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORDProphesy ye not say they to them that prophesy they shall not prophesy to them that they shall not take shameO thou that art named the house of Jacob is the spirit of the LORD straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightlyEven of late my people is risen up as an enemy ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from warThe women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses from their children have ye taken away my glory for everArise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destructionIf a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie saying I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be the prophet of this peopleI will surely assemble O Jacob all of thee I will surely gather the remnant of Israel I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of menThe breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the LORD on the head of themAnd I said Hear I pray you O heads of Jacob and ye princes of the house of Israel Is it not for you to know judgmentWho hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bonesWho also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldronThen shall they cry unto the LORD but he will not hear them he will even hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved themselves ill in their doingsThus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err that bite with their teeth and cry Peace and he that putteth not into their mouths they even prepare war against himTherefore night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark over themThen shall the seers be ashamed and the diviners confounded yea they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of GodBut truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD and of judgment and of might to declare unto Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sinHear this I pray you ye heads of the house of Jacob and princes of the house of Israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equityThey build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquityThe heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the LORD and say Is not the LORD among us none evil can come upon usTherefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forestBut in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto itAnd many nations shall come and say Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD and to the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law shall go forth of Zion and the word of the LORD from JerusalemAnd he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up a sword against nation neither shall they learn war any moreBut they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken itFor all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and everIn that day saith the LORD will I assemble her that halteth and I will gather her that is driven out and her that I have afflictedAnd I will make her that halted a remnant and her that was cast far off a strong nation and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for everAnd thou O tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of Zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion the kingdom shall come to the daughter of JerusalemNow why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy counseller perished for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travailBe in pain and labour to bring forth O daughter of Zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to Babylon there shalt thou be delivered there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemiesNow also many nations are gathered against thee that say Let her be defiled and let our eye look upon ZionBut they know not the thoughts of the LORD neither understand they his counsel for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floorArise and thresh O daughter of Zion for I will make thine horn iron and I will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many people and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earthNow gather thyself in troops O daughter of troops he hath laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheekBut thou Bethlehem Ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlastingTherefore will he give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of IsraelAnd he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earthAnd this man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal menAnd they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth within our bordersAnd the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not for man nor waiteth for the sons of menAnd the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces and none can deliverThine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries and all thine enemies shall be cut offAnd it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and I will destroy thy chariotsAnd I will cut off the cities of thy land and throw down all thy strong holdsAnd I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayersThy graven images also will I cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine handsAnd I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will I destroy thy citiesAnd I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen such as they have not heardHear ye now what the LORD saith Arise contend thou before the mountains and let the hills hear thy voiceHear ye O mountains the LORDs controversy and ye strong foundations of the earth for the LORD hath a controversy with his people and he will plead with IsraelO my people what have I done unto thee and wherein have I wearied thee testify against meFor I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of servants and I sent before thee Moses Aaron and MiriamO my people remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the LORDWherewith shall I come before the LORD and bow myself before the high God shall I come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year oldWill the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soulHe hath shewed thee O man what is good and what doth the LORD require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy GodThe LORDs voice crieth unto the city and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed itAre there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abominableShall I count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful weightsFor the rich men thereof are full of violence and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in their mouthTherefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee in making thee desolate because of thy sinsThou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not deliver and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the swordThou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and sweet wine but shalt not drink wineFor the statutes of Omri are kept and all the works of the house of Ahab and ye walk in their counsels that I should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof an hissing therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my peopleWoe is me for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits as the grapegleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the firstripe fruitThe good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a netThat they may do evil with both hands earnestly the prince asketh and the judge asketh for a reward and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire so they wrap it upThe best of them is as a brier the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh now shall be their perplexityTrust ye not in a friend put ye not confidence in a guide keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosomFor the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law a mans enemies are the men of his own houseTherefore I will look unto the LORD I will wait for the God of my salvation my God will hear meRejoice not against me O mine enemy when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the LORD shall be a light unto meI will bear the indignation of the LORD because I have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and I shall behold his righteousnessThen she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me Where is the LORD thy God mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streetsIn the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the decree be far removedIn that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria and from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountainNotwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein for the fruit of their doingsFeed thy people with thy rod the flock of thine heritage which dwell solitarily in the wood in the midst of Carmel let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of oldAccording to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous thingsThe nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deafThey shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth they shall be afraid of the LORD our God and shall fear because of theeWho is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercyHe will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the seaThou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of oldThe burden of Nineveh The book of the vision of Nahum the ElkoshiteGod is jealous and the LORD revengeth the LORD revengeth and is furious the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserveth wrath for his enemiesThe LORD is slow to anger and great in power and will not at all acquit the wicked the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feetHe rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the rivers Bashan languisheth and Carmel and the flower of Lebanon languishethThe mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell thereinWho can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by himThe LORD is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in himBut with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemiesWhat do ye imagine against the LORD he will make an utter end affliction shall not rise up the second timeFor while they be folden together as thorns and while they are drunken as drunkards they shall be devoured as stubble fully dryThere is one come out of thee that imagineth evil against the LORD a wicked counsellerThus saith the LORD Though they be quiet and likewise many yet thus shall they be cut down when he shall pass through Though I have afflicted thee I will afflict thee no moreFor now will I break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in sunderAnd the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image I will make thy grave for thou art vileBehold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace O Judah keep thy solemn feasts perform thy vows for the wicked shall no more pass through thee he is utterly cut offHe that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face keep the munition watch the way make thy loins strong fortify thy power mightilyFor the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob as the excellency of Israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branchesThe shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shakenThe chariots shall rage in the streets they shall justle one against another in the broad ways they shall seem like torches they shall run like the lightningsHe shall recount his worthies they shall stumble in their walk they shall make hast to the wall thereof and the defence shall be preparedThe gates of the rivers shall be opened and the palace shall be dissolvedAnd Huzzab shall be led away captive she shall be brought up and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves tabering upon their breastsBut Nineveh is of old like a pool of water yet they shall flee away Stand stand shall they cry but none shall look backTake ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furnitureShe is empty and void and waste and the heart melteth and the knees smite together and much pain is in all loins and the faces of them all gather blacknessWhere is the dwelling of the lions and the feedingplace of the young lions where the lion even the old lion walked and the lions whelp and none made them afraidThe lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his holes with prey and his dens with ravinBehold I am against thee saith the LORD of hosts and I will burn her chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour thy young lions and I will cut off thy prey from the earth and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heardWoe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and robbery the prey departeth notThe noise of a whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels and of the pransing horses and of the jumping chariotsThe horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of carcases and there is none end of their corpses they stumble upon their corpsesBecause of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations through her whoredoms and families through her witchcraftsBehold I am against thee saith the LORD of hosts and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face and I will shew the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shameAnd I will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile and will set thee as a gazingstockAnd it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say Nineveh is laid waste who will bemoan her whence shall I seek comforters for theeArt thou better than populous No that was situate among the rivers that had the waters round about it whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the seaEthiopia and Egypt were her strength and it was infinite Put and Lubim were thy helpersYet was she carried away she went into captivity her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chainsThou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemyAll thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs if they be shaken they shall even fall into the mouth of the eaterBehold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies the fire shall devour thy barsDraw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkilnThere shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm make thyself many as the cankerworm make thyself many as the locustsThou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the cankerworm spoileth and flieth awayThy crowned are as the locusts and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day but when the sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they areThy shepherds slumber O king of Assyria thy nobles shall dwell in the dust thy people is scattered upon the mountains and no man gathereth themThere is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continuallyThe burden which Habakkuk the prophet did seeO LORD how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear even cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not saveWhy dost thou shew me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contentionTherefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedethBehold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvellously for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told youFor lo I raise up the Chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirsThey are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselvesTheir horses also are swifter than the leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen shall spread themselves and their horsemen shall come from far they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eatThey shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the east wind and they shall gather the captivity as the sandAnd they shall scoff at the kings and the princes shall be a scorn unto them they shall deride every strong hold for they shall heap dust and take itThen shall his mind change and he shall pass over and offend imputing this his power unto his godArt thou not from everlasting O LORD my God mine Holy One we shall not die O LORD thou hast ordained them for judgment and O mighty God thou hast established them for correctionThou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than heAnd makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over themThey take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are gladTherefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteousShall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nationsI will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reprovedAnd the LORD answered me and said Write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth itFor the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarryBehold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faithYea also because he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man neither keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and heapeth unto him all peopleShall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and to him that ladeth himself with thick clayShall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booties unto themBecause thou hast spoiled many nations all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell thereinWoe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the power of evilThou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people and hast sinned against thy soulFor the stone shall cry out of the wall and the beam out of the timber shall answer itWoe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by iniquityBehold is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanityFor the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the seaWoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink that puttest thy bottle to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakednessThou art filled with shame for glory drink thou also and let thy foreskin be uncovered the cup of the LORDs right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spewing shall be on thy gloryFor the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell thereinWhat profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idolsWoe unto him that saith to the wood Awake to the dumb stone Arise it shall teach Behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of itBut the LORD is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before himA prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon ShigionothO LORD I have heard thy speech and was afraid O LORD revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known in wrath remember mercyGod came from Teman and the Holy One from mount Paran Selah His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praiseAnd his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of his hand and there was the hiding of his powerBefore him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feetHe stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations and the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlastingI saw the tents of Cushan in affliction and the curtains of the land of Midian did trembleWas the LORD displeased against the rivers was thine anger against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvationThy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word Selah Thou didst cleave the earth with riversThe mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on highThe sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spearThou didst march through the land in indignation thou didst thresh the heathen in angerThou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people even for salvation with thine anointed thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked by discovering the foundation unto the neck SelahThou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretlyThou didst walk through the sea with thine horses through the heap of great watersWhen I heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entered into my bones and I trembled in myself that I might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troopsAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stallsYet I will rejoice in the LORD I will joy in the God of my salvationThe LORD God is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places To the chief singer on my stringed instrumentsThe word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi the son of Gedaliah the son of Amariah the son of Hizkiah in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of JudahI will utterly consume all things from off the land saith the LORDI will consume man and beast I will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumblingblocks with the wicked and I will cut off man from off the land saith the LORDI will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place and the name of the Chemarims with the priestsAnd them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the LORD and that swear by MalchamAnd them that are turned back from the LORD and those that have not sought the LORD nor inquired for himHold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD for the day of the LORD is at hand for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid his guestsAnd it shall come to pass in the day of the LORDs sacrifice that I will punish the princes and the kings children and all such as are clothed with strange apparelIn the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceitAnd it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and an howling from the second and a great crashing from the hillsHowl ye inhabitants of Maktesh for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut offAnd it shall come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their lees that say in their heart The LORD will not do good neither will he do evilTherefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereofThe great day of the LORD is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the LORD the mighty man shall cry there bitterlyThat day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darknessA day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and against the high towersAnd I will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the LORD and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dungNeither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORDs wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the landGather yourselves together yea gather together O nation not desiredBefore the decree bring forth before the day pass as the chaff before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you before the day of the LORDs anger come upon youSeek ye the LORD all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORDs angerFor Gaza shall be forsaken and Ashkelon a desolation they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day and Ekron shall be rooted upWoe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the Cherethites the word of the LORD is against you O Canaan the land of the Philistines I will even destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitantAnd the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds and folds for flocksAnd the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah they shall feed thereupon in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening for the LORD their God shall visit them and turn away their captivityI have heard the reproach of Moab and the revilings of the children of Ammon whereby they have reproached my people and magnified themselves against their borderTherefore as I live saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Surely Moab shall be as Sodom and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant of my people shall possess themThis shall they have for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hostsThe LORD will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the heathenYe Ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my swordAnd he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria and will make Nineveh a desolation and dry like a wildernessAnd flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar workThis is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart I am and there is none beside me how is she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his handWoe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing cityShe obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the LORD she drew not near to her GodHer princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrowHer prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the lawThe just LORD is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning doth he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shameI have cut off the nations their towers are desolate I made their streets waste that none passeth by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man that there is none inhabitantI said Surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive instruction so their dwelling should not be cut off howsoever I punished them but they rose early and corrupted all their doingsTherefore wait ye upon me saith the LORD until the day that I rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousyFor then will I turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the LORD to serve him with one consentFrom beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offeringIn that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountainI will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people and they shall trust in the name of the LORDThe remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraidSing O daughter of Zion shout O Israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart O daughter of JerusalemThe LORD hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of Israel even the LORD is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil any moreIn that day it shall be said to Jerusalem Fear thou not and to Zion Let not thine hands be slackThe LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singingI will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burdenBehold at that time I will undo all that afflict thee and I will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shameAt that time will I bring you again even in the time that I gather you for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes saith the LORDIn the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest sayingThus speaketh the LORD of hosts saying This people say The time is not come the time that the LORDs house should be builtThen came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet sayingIs it time for you O ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this house lie wasteNow therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts Consider your waysYe have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holesThus saith the LORD of hosts Consider your waysGo up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified saith the LORDYe looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home I did blow upon it Why saith the LORD of hosts Because of mine house that is waste and ye run every man unto his own houseTherefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruitAnd I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labour of the handsThen Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet as the LORD their God had sent him and the people did fear before the LORDThen spake Haggai the LORDs messenger in the LORDs message unto the people saying I am with you saith the LORDAnd the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts their GodIn the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the kingIn the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai sayingSpeak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest and to the residue of the people sayingWho is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothingYet now be strong O Zerubbabel saith the LORD and be strong O Joshua son of Josedech the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the LORD and work for I am with you saith the LORD of hostsAccording to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye notFor thus saith the LORD of hosts Yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry landAnd I will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the LORD of hostsThe silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the LORD of hostsThe glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the LORD of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the LORD of hostsIn the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts Ask now the priests concerning the law sayingIf one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy And the priests answered and said NoThen said Haggai If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these shall it be unclean And the priests answered and said It shall be uncleanThen answered Haggai and said So is this people and so is this nation before me saith the LORD and so is every work of their hands and that which they offer there is uncleanAnd now I pray you consider from this day and upward from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORDSince those days were when one came to an heap of twenty measures there were but ten when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press there were but twentyI smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the LORDConsider now from this day and upward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the LORDs temple was laid consider itIs the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth from this day will I bless youAnd again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month sayingSpeak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah saying I will shake the heavens and the earthAnd I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen and I will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brotherIn that day saith the LORD of hosts will I take thee O Zerubbabel my servant the son of Shealtiel saith the LORD and will make thee as a signet for I have chosen thee saith the LORD of hostsIn the eighth month in the second year of Darius came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet sayingThe LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathersTherefore say thou unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts Turn ye unto me saith the LORD of hosts and I will turn unto you saith the LORD of hostsBe ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have cried saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts Turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith the LORDYour fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for everBut my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they returned and said Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with usUpon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is the month Sebat in the second year of Darius came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet sayingI saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and whiteThen said I O my lord what are these And the angel that talked with me said unto me I will shew thee what these beAnd the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earthAnd they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees and said We have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at restThen the angel of the LORD answered and said O LORD of hosts how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten yearsAnd the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable wordsSo the angel that communed with me said unto me Cry thou saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousyAnd I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease for I was but a little displeased and they helped forward the afflictionTherefore thus saith the LORD I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the LORD of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon JerusalemCry yet saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion and shall yet choose JerusalemThen lifted I up mine eyes and saw and behold four hornsAnd I said unto the angel that talked with me What be these And he answered me These are the horns which have scattered Judah Israel and JerusalemAnd the LORD shewed me four carpentersThen said I What come these to do And he spake saying These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man did lift up his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of the Gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter itI lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring line in his handThen said I Whither goest thou And he said unto me To measure Jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereofAnd behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet himAnd said unto him Run speak to this young man saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle thereinFor I saith the LORD will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of herHo ho come forth and flee from the land of the north saith the LORD for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven saith the LORDDeliver thyself O Zion that dwellest with the daughter of BabylonFor thus saith the LORD of hosts After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eyeFor behold I will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent meSing and rejoice O daughter of Zion for lo I come and I will dwell in the midst of thee saith the LORDAnd many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day and shall be my people and I will dwell in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto theeAnd the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose Jerusalem againBe silent O all flesh before the LORD for he is raised up out of his holy habitationAnd he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD and Satan standing at his right hand to resist himAnd the LORD said unto Satan The LORD rebuke thee O Satan even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fireNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angelAnd he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying Take away the filthy garments from him And unto him he said Behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of raimentAnd I said Let them set a fair mitre upon his head So they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments And the angel of the LORD stood byAnd the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts If thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand byHear now O Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold I will bring forth my servant the BRANCHFor behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold I will engrave the graving thereof saith the LORD of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one dayIn that day saith the LORD of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig treeAnd the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleepAnd said unto me What seest thou And I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereofAnd two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereofSo I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying What are these my lordThen the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me Knowest thou not what these be And I said No my lordThen he answered and spake unto me saying This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel saying Not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the LORD of hostsWho art thou O great mountain before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace grace unto itMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me sayingThe hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto youFor who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the LORD which run to and fro through the whole earthThen answered I and said unto him What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereofAnd I answered again and said unto him What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselvesAnd he answered me and said Knowest thou not what these be And I said No my lordThen said he These are the two anointed ones that stand by the LORD of the whole earthThen I turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a flying rollAnd he said unto me What seest thou And I answered I see a flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubitsThen said he unto me This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to itI will bring it forth saith the LORD of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereofThen the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me Lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forthAnd I said What is it And he said This is an ephah that goeth forth He said moreover This is their resemblance through all the earthAnd behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephahAnd he said This is wickedness And he cast it into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereofThen lifted I up mine eyes and looked and behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavenThen said I to the angel that talked with me Whither do these bear the ephahAnd he said unto me To build it an house in the land of Shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her own baseAnd I turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brassIn the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horsesAnd in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horsesThen I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me What are these my lordAnd the angel answered and said unto me These are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earthThe black horses which are therein go forth into the north country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth toward the south countryAnd the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth and he said Get you hence walk to and fro through the earth So they walked to and fro through the earthThen cried he upon me and spake unto me saying Behold these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north countryAnd the word of the LORD came unto me sayingTake of them of the captivity even of Heldai of Tobijah and of Jedaiah which are come from Babylon and come thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of ZephaniahThen take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech the high priestAnd speak unto him saying Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts saying Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the LORDEven he shall build the temple of the LORD and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them bothAnd the crowns shall be to Helem and to Tobijah and to Jedaiah and to Hen the son of Zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the LORDAnd they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you And this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your GodAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month even in ChisleuWhen they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech and their men to pray before the LORDAnd to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts and to the prophets saying Should I weep in the fifth month separating myself as I have done these so many yearsThen came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me sayingSpeak unto all the people of the land and to the priests saying When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did ye at all fast unto me even to meAnd when ye did eat and when ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselvesShould ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and the plainAnd the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah sayingThus speaketh the LORD of hosts saying Execute true judgment and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brotherAnd oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heartBut they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hearYea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hostsTherefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they cried and I would not hear saith the LORD of hostsBut I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not Thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant land desolateAgain the word of the LORD of hosts came to me sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy and I was jealous for her with great furyThus saith the LORD I am returned unto Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountainThus saith the LORD of hosts There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem and every man with his staff in his hand for very ageAnd the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereofThus saith the LORD of hosts If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days should it also be marvellous in mine eyes saith the LORD of hostsThus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will save my people from the east country and from the west countryAnd I will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and they shall be my people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousnessThus saith the LORD of hosts Let your hands be strong ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid that the temple might be builtFor before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction for I set all men every one against his neighbourBut now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days saith the LORD of hostsFor the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these thingsAnd it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen O house of Judah and house of Israel so will I save you and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strongFor thus saith the LORD of hosts As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the LORD of hosts and I repented notSo again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah fear ye notThese are the things that ye shall do Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gatesAnd let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour and love no false oath for all these are things that I hate saith the LORDAnd the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me sayingThus saith the LORD of hosts The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts therefore love the truth and peaceThus saith the LORD of hosts It shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many citiesAnd the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts I will go alsoYea many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to pray before the LORDThus saith the LORD of hosts In those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew saying We will go with you for we have heard that God is with youThe burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach and Damascus shall be the rest thereof when the eyes of man as of all the tribes of Israel shall be toward the LORDAnd Hamath also shall border thereby Tyrus and Zidon though it be very wiseAnd Tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streetsBehold the Lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fireAshkelon shall see it and fear Gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful and Ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed and the king shall perish from Gaza and Ashkelon shall not be inhabitedAnd a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod and I will cut off the pride of the PhilistinesAnd I will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth but he that remaineth even he shall be for our God and he shall be as a governor in Judah and Ekron as a JebusiteAnd I will encamp about mine house because of the army because of him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have I seen with mine eyesRejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout O daughter of Jerusalem behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an assAnd I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from river even to the ends of the earthAs for thee also by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no waterTurn you to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope even to day do I declare that I will render double unto theeWhen I have bent Judah for me filled the bow with Ephraim and raised up thy sons O Zion against thy sons O Greece and made thee as the sword of a mighty manAnd the LORD shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet and shall go with whirlwinds of the southThe LORD of hosts shall defend them and they shall devour and subdue with sling stones and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine and they shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altarAnd the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an ensign upon his landFor how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maidsAsk ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain so the LORD shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the fieldFor the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherdMine anger was kindled against the shepherds and I punished the goats for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battleOut of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor togetherAnd they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the LORD is with them and the riders on horses shall be confoundedAnd I will strengthen the house of Judah and I will save the house of Joseph and I will bring them again to place them for I have mercy upon them and they shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the LORD their God and will hear themAnd they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the LORDI will hiss for them and gather them for I have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increasedAnd I will sow them among the people and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn againI will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon and place shall not be found for themAnd he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry up and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart awayAnd I will strengthen them in the LORD and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the LORDOpen thy doors O Lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedarsHowl fir tree for the cedar is fallen because the mighty are spoiled howl O ye oaks of Bashan for the forest of the vintage is come downThere is a voice of the howling of the shepherds for their glory is spoiled a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of Jordan is spoiledThus saith the LORD my God Feed the flock of the slaughterWhose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say Blessed be the LORD for I am rich and their own shepherds pity them notFor I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith the LORD but lo I will deliver the men every one into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land and out of their hand I will not deliver themAnd I will feed the flock of slaughter even you O poor of the flock And I took unto me two staves the one I called Beauty and the other I called Bands and I fed the flockThree shepherds also I cut off in one month and my soul lothed them and their soul also abhorred meThen said I I will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of anotherAnd I took my staff even Beauty and cut it assunder that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peopleAnd it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORDAnd I said unto them If ye think good give me my price and if not forbear So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silverAnd the LORD said unto me Cast it unto the potter a goodly price that I was prised at of them And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORDThen I cut asunder mine other staff even Bands that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and IsraelAnd the LORD said unto me Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherdFor lo I will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in piecesWoe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkenedThe burden of the word of the LORD for Israel saith the LORD which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within himBehold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against JerusalemAnd in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against itIn that day saith the LORD I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah and will smite every horse of the people with blindnessAnd the governors of Judah shall say in their heart The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their GodIn that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in JerusalemThe LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against JudahIn that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David and the house of David shall be as God as the angel of the LORD before themAnd it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against JerusalemAnd I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstbornIn that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of MegiddonAnd the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of David apart and their wives apart the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apartThe family of the house of Levi apart and their wives apart the family of Shimei apart and their wives apartAll the families that remain every family apart and their wives apartIn that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleannessAnd it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD of hosts that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the landAnd it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him Thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesiethAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceiveBut he shall say I am no prophet I am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle from my youthAnd one shall say unto him What are these wounds in thine hands Then he shall answer Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friendsAwake O sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the LORD of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and I will turn mine hand upon the little onesAnd it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the LORD two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left thereinAnd I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say It is my people and they shall say The LORD is my GodBehold the day of the LORD cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of theeFor I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the cityThen shall the LORD go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battleAnd his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the east and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the southAnd ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal yea ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the LORD my God shall come and all the saints with theeAnd it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor darkBut it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be lightAnd it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward the hinder sea in summer and in winter shall it beAnd the LORD shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one LORD and his name oneAll the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from Benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate unto the corner gate and from the tower of Hananeel unto the kings winepressesAnd men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter destruction but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabitedAnd this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouthAnd it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbourAnd Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in great abundanceAnd so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents as this plagueAnd it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King the LORD of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernaclesAnd it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King the LORD of hosts even upon them shall be no rainAnd if the family of Egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernaclesThis shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernaclesIn that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD and the pots in the LORDs house shall be like the bowls before the altarYea every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and seethe therein and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hostsThe burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by MalachiI have loved you saith the LORD Yet ye say Wherein hast thou loved us Was not Esau Jacobs brother saith the LORD yet I loved JacobAnd I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wildernessWhereas Edom saith We are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thus saith the LORD of hosts They shall build but I will throw down and they shall call them The border of wickedness and The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for everAnd your eyes shall see and ye shall say The LORD will be magnified from the border of IsraelA son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then I be a father where is mine honour and if I be a master where is my fear saith the LORD of hosts unto you O priests that despise my name And ye say Wherein have we despised thy nameYe offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say Wherein have we polluted thee In that ye say The table of the LORD is contemptibleAnd if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith the LORD of hostsAnd now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the LORD of hostsWho is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought I have no pleasure in you saith the LORD of hosts neither will I accept an offering at your handFor from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen saith the LORD of hostsBut ye have profaned it in that ye say The table of the LORD is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptibleYe said also Behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed at it saith the LORD of hosts and ye brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should I accept this of your hand saith the LORDBut cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing for I am a great King saith the LORD of hosts and my name is dreadful among the heathenAnd now O ye priests this commandment is for youIf ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith the LORD of hosts I will even send a curse upon you and I will curse your blessings yea I have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heartBehold I will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with itAnd ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant might be with Levi saith the LORD of hostsMy covenant was with him of life and peace and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my nameThe law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquityFor the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the LORD of hostsBut ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi saith the LORD of hostsTherefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the lawHave we not all one father hath not one God created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathersJudah hath dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved and hath married the daughter of a strange godThe LORD will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of Jacob and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hostsAnd this have ye done again covering the altar of the LORD with tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your handYet ye say Wherefore Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenantAnd did not he make one Yet had he the residue of the spirit And wherefore one That he might seek a godly seed Therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youthFor the LORD the God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the LORD of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherouslyYe have wearied the LORD with your words Yet ye say Wherein have we wearied him When ye say Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD and he delighteth in them or Where is the God of judgmentBehold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to this temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the LORD of hostsBut who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soapAnd he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousnessThen shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD as in the days of old and as in former yearsAnd I will come near to you to judgment and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the LORD of hostsFor I am the LORD I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumedEven from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them Return unto me and I will return unto you saith the LORD of hosts But ye said Wherein shall we returnWill a man rob God Yet ye have robbed me But ye say Wherein have we robbed thee In tithes and offeringsYe are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nationBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the LORD of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive itAnd I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the LORD of hostsAnd all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the LORD of hostsYour words have been stout against me saith the LORD Yet ye say What have we spoken so much against theeYe have said It is vain to serve God and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hostsAnd now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God are even deliveredThen they that feared the LORD spake often one to another and the LORD hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD and that thought upon his nameAnd they shall be mine saith the LORD of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth himThen shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him notFor behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the LORD of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branchBut unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stallAnd ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the LORD of hostsRemember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgmentsBehold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORDAnd he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curseThe book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of AbrahamAbraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat

from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generationsNow the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy GhostThen Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privilyBut while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy GhostAnd she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name JESUS for he shall save his people from their sinsNow all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet sayingBehold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with usThen Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wifeAnd knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name JESUSNow when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to JerusalemSaying Where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship himWhen Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with himAnd when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be bornAnd they said unto him In Bethlehem of Judaea for thus it is written by the prophetAnd thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda for out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people IsraelThen Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appearedAnd he sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him alsoWhen they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child wasWhen they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joyAnd when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrhAnd being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another wayAnd when they were departed behold the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream saying Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy himWhen he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into EgyptAnd was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Out of Egypt have I called my sonThen Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise menThen was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet sayingIn Rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are notBut when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in EgyptSaying Arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for they are dead which sought the young childs lifeAnd he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of IsraelBut when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of God in a dream he turned aside into the parts of GalileeAnd he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets He shall be called a NazareneIn those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of JudaeaAnd saying Repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at handFor this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias saying The voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straightAnd the same John had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honeyThen went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the region round about JordanAnd were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sinsBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them O generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to comeBring forth therefore fruits meet for repentanceAnd think not to say within yourselves We have Abraham to our father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto AbrahamAnd now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fireI indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fireWhose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fireThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of himBut John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to meAnd Jesus answering said unto him Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness Then he suffered himAnd Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon himAnd lo a voice from heaven saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleasedThen was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devilAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungredAnd when the tempter came to him he said If thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made breadBut he answered and said It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of GodThen the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the templeAnd saith unto him If thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written He shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stoneJesus said unto him It is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy GodAgain the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of themAnd saith unto him All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship meThen saith Jesus unto him Get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serveThen the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto himNow when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into GalileeAnd leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of Zabulon and NephthalimThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet sayingThe land of Zabulon and the land of Nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond Jordan Galilee of the GentilesThe people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung upFrom that time Jesus began to preach and to say Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at handAnd Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishersAnd he saith unto them Follow me and I will make you fishers of menAnd they straightway left their nets and followed himAnd going on from thence he saw other two brethren James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in a ship with Zebedee their father mending their nets and he called themAnd they immediately left the ship and their father and followed himAnd Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the peopleAnd his fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed themAnd there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee and from Decapolis and from Jerusalem and from Judaea and from beyond JordanAnd seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto himAnd he opened his mouth and taught them sayingBlessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heavenBlessed are they that mourn for they shall be comfortedBlessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earthBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filledBlessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercyBlessed are the pure in heart for they shall see GodBlessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of GodBlessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heavenBlessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sakeRejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before youYe are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of menYe are the light of the world A city that is set on an hill cannot be hidNeither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the houseLet your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heavenThink not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfilFor verily I say unto you Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilledWhosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heavenFor I say unto you That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heavenYe have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgmentBut I say unto you That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother Raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say Thou fool shall be in danger of hell fireTherefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against theeLeave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy giftAgree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prisonVerily I say unto thee Thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthingYe have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adulteryBut I say unto you That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heartAnd if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hellAnd if thy right hand offend thee cut if off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hellIt hath been said Whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcementBut I say unto you That whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adulteryAgain ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time Thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oathsBut I say unto you Swear not at all neither by heaven for it is Gods throneNor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great KingNeither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or blackBut let your communication be Yea yea Nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evilYe have heard that it hath been said An eye for an eye and a tooth for a toothBut I say unto you That ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other alsoAnd if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloke alsoAnd whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twainGive to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou awayYe have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemyBut I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute youThat ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjustFor if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the sameAnd if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans soBe ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfectTake heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heavenTherefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men Verily I say unto you They have their rewardBut when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doethThat thine alms may be in secret and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openlyAnd when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men Verily I say unto you They have their rewardBut thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy Father which is in secret and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openlyBut when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speakingBe not ye therefore like unto them for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask himAfter this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy nameThy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heavenGive us this day our daily breadAnd forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtorsAnd lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever AmenFor if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive youBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespassesMoreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast Verily I say unto you They have their rewardBut thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy faceThat thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy Father which is in secret and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openlyLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and stealBut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor stealFor where your treasure is there will your heart be alsoThe light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of lightBut if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darknessNo man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other Ye cannot serve God and mammonTherefore I say unto you Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on Is not the life more than meat and the body than raimentBehold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them Are ye not much better than theyWhich of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his statureAnd why take ye thought for raiment Consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spinAnd yet I say unto you That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theseWherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faithTherefore take no thought saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or Wherewithal shall we be clothedFor after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these thingsBut seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto youTake therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereofJudge not that ye be not judgedFor with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you againAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eyeOr how wilt thou say to thy brother Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eyeThou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eyeGive not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend youAsk and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto youFor every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be openedOr what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stoneOr if he ask a fish will he give him a serpentIf ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask himTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophetsEnter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereatBecause strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find itBeware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolvesYe shall know them by their fruits Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistlesEven so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruitA good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruitEvery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fireWherefore by their fruits ye shall know themNot every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heavenMany will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful worksAnd then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquityTherefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rockAnd the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rockAnd every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sandAnd the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of itAnd it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrineFor he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribesWhen he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed himAnd behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me cleanAnd Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean And immediately his leprosy was cleansedAnd Jesus saith unto him See thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto themAnd when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching himAnd saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormentedAnd Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal himThe centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healedFor I am a man under authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man Go and he goeth and to another Come and he cometh and to my servant Do this and he doeth itWhen Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed Verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in IsraelAnd I say unto you That many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heavenBut the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teethAnd Jesus said unto the centurion Go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee And his servant was healed in the selfsame hourAnd when Jesus was come into Peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a feverAnd he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto themWhen the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sickThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet saying Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknessesNow when Jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other sideAnd a certain scribe came and said unto him Master I will follow thee whithersoever thou goestAnd Jesus saith unto him The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his headAnd another of his disciples said unto him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my fatherBut Jesus said unto him Follow me and let the dead bury their deadAnd when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed himAnd behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleepAnd his disciples came to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perishAnd he saith unto them Why are ye fearful O ye of little faith Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calmBut the men marvelled saying What manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey himAnd when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that wayAnd behold they cried out saying What have we to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God art thou come hither to torment us before the timeAnd there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feedingSo the devils besought him saying If thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swineAnd he said unto them Go And when they were come out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the watersAnd they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the devilsAnd behold the whole city came out to meet Jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coastsAnd he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own cityAnd behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy Son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven theeAnd behold certain of the scribes said within themselves This man blasphemethAnd Jesus knowing their thoughts said Wherefore think ye evil in your heartsFor whether is easier to say Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say Arise and walkBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy Arise take up thy bed and go unto thine houseAnd he arose and departed to his houseBut when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified God which had given such power unto menAnd as Jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him Follow me And he arose and followed himAnd it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciplesAnd when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinnersBut when Jesus heard that he said unto them They that be whole need not a physician but they that are sickBut go ye and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentanceThen came to him the disciples of John saying Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast notAnd Jesus said unto them Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fastNo man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worseNeither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preservedWhile he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying My daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall liveAnd Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciplesAnd behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garmentFor she said within herself If I may but touch his garment I shall be wholeBut Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said Daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole And the woman was made whole from that hourAnd when Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noiseHe said unto them Give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth And they laughed him to scornBut when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid aroseAnd the fame hereof went abroad into all that landAnd when Jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying Thou Son of David have mercy on usAnd when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and Jesus saith unto them Believe ye that I am able to do this They said unto him Yea LordThen touched he their eyes saying According to your faith be it unto youAnd their eyes were opened and Jesus straitly charged them saying See that no man know itBut they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that countryAs they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devilAnd when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying It was never so seen in IsraelBut the Pharisees said He casteth out devils through the prince of the devilsAnd Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the peopleBut when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherdThen saith he unto his disciples The harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are fewPray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvestAnd when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseaseNow the names of the twelve apostles are these The first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brotherPhilip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the publican James the son of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus whose surname was ThaddaeusSimon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed himThese twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying Go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye notBut go rather to the lost sheep of the house of IsraelAnd as ye go preach saying The kingdom of heaven is at handHeal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely giveProvide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your pursesNor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meatAnd into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter inquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thenceAnd when ye come into an house salute itAnd if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to youAnd whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feetVerily I say unto you It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that cityBehold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as dovesBut beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagoguesAnd ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the GentilesBut when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speakFor it is not ye that speak but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in youAnd the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to deathAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be savedBut when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily I say unto you Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man be comeThe disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lordIt is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his householdFear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be knownWhat I tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetopsAnd fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hellAre not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your FatherBut the very hairs of your head are all numberedFear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrowsWhosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heavenBut whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heavenThink not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to send peace but a swordFor I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in lawAnd a mans foes shall be they of his own householdHe that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of meAnd he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of meHe that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find itHe that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent meHe that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans rewardAnd whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his rewardAnd it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their citiesNow when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciplesAnd said unto him Art thou he that should come or do we look for anotherJesus answered and said unto them Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and seeThe blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to themAnd blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in meAnd as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John What went ye out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken with the windBut what went ye out for to see A man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings housesBut what went ye out for to see A prophet yea I say unto you and more than a prophetFor this is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before theeVerily I say unto you Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than heAnd from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by forceFor all the prophets and the law prophesied until JohnAnd if ye will receive it this is Elias which was for to comeHe that hath ears to hear let him hearBut whereunto shall I liken this generation It is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellowsAnd saying We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamentedFor John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He hath a devilThe Son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners But wisdom is justified of her childrenThen began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented notWoe unto thee Chorazin woe unto thee Bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashesBut I say unto you It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for youAnd thou Capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained until this dayBut I say unto you That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for theeAt that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babesEven so Father for so it seemed good in thy sightAll things are delivered unto me of my Father and no man knoweth the Son but the Father neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal himCome unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you restTake my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soulsFor my yoke is easy and my burden is lightAt that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eatBut when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath dayBut he said unto them Have ye not read what David did when he was an hungred and they that were with himHow he entered into the house of God and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priestsOr have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blamelessBut I say unto you That in this place is one greater than the templeBut if ye had known what this meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltlessFor the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath dayAnd when he was departed thence he went into their synagogueAnd behold there was a man which had his hand withered And they asked him saying Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they might accuse himAnd he said unto them What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it outHow much then is a man better than a sheep Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath daysThen saith he to the man Stretch forth thine hand And he stretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the otherThen the Pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy himBut when Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them allAnd charged them that they should not make him knownThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet sayingBehold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the GentilesHe shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streetsA bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victoryAnd in his name shall the Gentiles trustThen was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and sawAnd all the people were amazed and said Is not this the son of DavidBut when the Pharisees heard it they said This fellow doth not cast out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devilsAnd Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not standAnd if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom standAnd if I by Beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judgesBut if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto youOr else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his houseHe that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroadWherefore I say unto you All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto menAnd whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to comeEither make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruitO generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speakethA good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil thingsBut I say unto you That every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgmentFor by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemnedThen certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from theeBut he answered and said unto them An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet JonasFor as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earthThe men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is hereThe queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is hereWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth noneThen he saith I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnishedThen goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generationWhile he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with himThen one said unto him Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with theeBut he answered and said unto him that told him Who is my mother and who are my brethrenAnd he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said Behold my mother and my brethrenFor whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and motherThe same day went Jesus out of the house and sat by the sea sideAnd great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shoreAnd he spake many things unto them in parables saying Behold a sower went forth to sowAnd when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them upSome fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earthAnd when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered awayAnd some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked themBut other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfoldWho hath ears to hear let him hearAnd the disciples came and said unto him Why speakest thou unto them in parablesHe answered and said unto them Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not givenFor whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hathTherefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understandAnd in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith By hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceiveFor this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal themBut blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hearFor verily I say unto you That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard themHear ye therefore the parable of the sowerWhen any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart This is he which received seed by the way sideBut he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth itYet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offendedHe also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitfulBut he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirtyAnother parable put he forth unto them saying The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his fieldBut while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his wayBut when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares alsoSo the servants of the householder came and said unto him Sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it taresHe said unto them An enemy hath done this The servants said unto him Wilt thou then that we go and gather them upBut he said Nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with themLet both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barnAnother parable put he forth unto them saying The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his fieldWhich indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereofAnother parable spake he unto them The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavenedAll these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto themThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the worldThen Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the fieldHe answered and said unto them He that soweth the good seed is the Son of manThe field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked oneThe enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angelsAs therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this worldThe Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquityAnd shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teethThen shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father Who hath ears to hear let him hearAgain the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that fieldAgain the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearlsWho when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought itAgain the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kindWhich when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad awaySo shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the justAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teethJesus saith unto them Have ye understood all these things They say unto him Yea LordThen said he unto them Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and oldAnd it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these parables he departed thenceAnd when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said Whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty worksIs not this the carpenters son is not his mother called Mary and his brethren James and Joses and Simon and JudasAnd his sisters are they not all with us Whence then hath this man all these thingsAnd they were offended in him But Jesus said unto them A prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own houseAnd he did not many mighty works there because of their unbeliefAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of JesusAnd said unto his servants This is John the Baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in himFor Herod had laid hold on John and bound him and put him in prison for Herodias sake his brother Philips wifeFor John said unto him It is not lawful for thee to have herAnd when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophetBut when Herods birthday was kept the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased HerodWhereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would askAnd she being before instructed of her mother said Give me here John Baptists head in a chargerAnd the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given herAnd he sent and beheaded John in the prisonAnd his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her motherAnd his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told JesusWhen Jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the citiesAnd Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sickAnd when it was evening his disciples came to him saying This is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victualsBut Jesus said unto them They need not depart give ye them to eatAnd they say unto him We have here but five loaves and two fishesHe said Bring them hither to meAnd he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitudeAnd they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets fullAnd they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and childrenAnd straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes awayAnd when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there aloneBut the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contraryAnd in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the seaAnd when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying It is a spirit and they cried out for fearBut straightway Jesus spake unto them saying Be of good cheer it is I be not afraidAnd Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the waterAnd he said Come And when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to JesusBut when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save meAnd immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubtAnd when they were come into the ship the wind ceasedThen they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying Of a truth thou art the Son of GodAnd when they were gone over they came into the land of GennesaretAnd when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseasedAnd besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly wholeThen came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem sayingWhy do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat breadBut he answered and said unto them Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your traditionFor God commanded saying Honour thy father and mother and He that curseth father or mother let him die the deathBut ye say Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by meAnd honour not his father or his mother he shall be free Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your traditionYe hypocrites well did Esaias prophesy of you sayingThis people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from meBut in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of menAnd he called the multitude and said unto them Hear and understandNot that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a manThen came his disciples and said unto him Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this sayingBut he answered and said Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted upLet them alone they be blind leaders of the blind And if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditchThen answered Peter and said unto him Declare unto us this parableAnd Jesus said Are ye also yet without understandingDo not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draughtBut those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the manFor out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemiesThese are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a manThen Jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of Tyre and SidonAnd behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying Have mercy on me O Lord thou Son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devilBut he answered her not a word And his disciples came and besought him saying Send her away for she crieth after usBut he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of IsraelThen came she and worshipped him saying Lord help meBut he answered and said It is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to dogsAnd she said Truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters tableThen Jesus answered and said unto her O woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt And her daughter was made whole from that very hourAnd Jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down thereAnd great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at Jesus feet and he healed themInsomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the God of IsraelThen Jesus called his disciples unto him and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the wayAnd his disciples say unto him Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitudeAnd Jesus saith unto them How many loaves have ye And they said Seven and a few little fishesAnd he commanded the multitude to sit down on the groundAnd he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitudeAnd they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets fullAnd they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and childrenAnd he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the coasts of MagdalaThe Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heavenHe answered and said unto them When it is evening ye say It will be fair weather for the sky is redAnd in the morning It will be foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowring O ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the timesA wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonas And he left them and departedAnd when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take breadThen Jesus said unto them Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the SadduceesAnd they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have taken no breadWhich when Jesus perceived he said unto them O ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no breadDo ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took upNeither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took upHow is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the SadduceesThen understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the SadduceesWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying Whom do men say that I the Son of man amAnd they said Some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophetsHe saith unto them But whom say ye that I amAnd Simon Peter answered and said Thou art the Christ the Son of the living GodAnd Jesus answered and said unto him Blessed art thou Simon Barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heavenAnd I say also unto thee That thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against itAnd I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heavenThen charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the ChristFrom that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third dayThen Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying Be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto theeBut he turned and said unto Peter Get thee behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of menThen said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow meFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find itFor what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soulFor the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his worksVerily I say unto you There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdomAnd after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apartAnd was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the lightAnd behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with himThen answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for EliasWhile he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye himAnd when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraidAnd Jesus came and touched them and said Arise and be not afraidAnd when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus onlyAnd as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying Tell the vision to no man until the Son of man be risen again from the deadAnd his disciples asked him saying Why then say the scribes that Elias must first comeAnd Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all thingsBut I say unto you That Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of themThen the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the BaptistAnd when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and sayingLord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the waterAnd I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure himThen Jesus answered and said O faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to meAnd Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hourThen came the disciples to Jesus apart and said Why could not we cast him outAnd Jesus said unto them Because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain Remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto youHowbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fastingAnd while they abode in Galilee Jesus said unto them The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of menAnd they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again And they were exceeding sorryAnd when they were come to Capernaum they that received tribute money came to Peter and said Doth not your master pay tributeHe saith Yes And when he was come into the house Jesus prevented him saying What thinkest thou Simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangersPeter saith unto him Of strangers Jesus saith unto him Then are the children freeNotwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and theeAt the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heavenAnd Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of themAnd said Verily I say unto you Except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heavenWhosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heavenAnd whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth meBut whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the seaWoe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence comethWherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fireAnd if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fireTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heavenFor the Son of man is come to save that which was lostHow think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astrayAnd if so be that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astrayEven so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perishMoreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brotherBut if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be establishedAnd if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publicanVerily I say unto you Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heavenAgain I say unto you That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heavenFor where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of themThen came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven timesJesus saith unto him I say not unto thee Until seven times but Until seventy times sevenTherefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servantsAnd when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talentsBut forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be madeThe servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee allThen the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debtBut the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying Pay me that thou owestAnd his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying Have patience with me and I will pay thee allAnd he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debtSo when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was doneThen his lord after that he had called him said unto him O thou wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst meShouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as I had pity on theeAnd his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto himSo likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespassesAnd it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings he departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond JordanAnd great multitudes followed him and he healed them thereThe Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every causeAnd he answered and said unto them Have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and femaleAnd said For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one fleshWherefore they are no more twain but one flesh What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunderThey say unto him Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her awayHe saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not soAnd I say unto you Whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adulteryHis disciples say unto him If the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marryBut he said unto them All men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is givenFor there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake He that is able to receive it let him receive itThen were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked themBut Jesus said Suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heavenAnd he laid his hands on them and departed thenceAnd behold one came and said unto him Good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal lifeAnd he said unto him Why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandmentsHe saith unto him Which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witnessHonour thy father and thy mother and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyselfThe young man saith unto him All these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yetJesus said unto him If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow meBut when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessionsThen said Jesus unto his disciples Verily I say unto you That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heavenAnd again I say unto you It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of GodWhen his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying Who then can be savedBut Jesus beheld them and said unto them With men this is impossible but with God all things are possibleThen answered Peter and said unto him Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have thereforeAnd Jesus said unto them Verily I say unto you That ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of IsraelAnd every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting lifeBut many that are first shall be last and the last shall be firstFor the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyardAnd when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyardAnd he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplaceAnd said unto them Go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you And they went their wayAgain he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewiseAnd about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them Why stand ye here all the day idleThey say unto him Because no man hath hired us He saith unto them Go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receiveSo when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward Call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the firstAnd when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a pennyBut when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a pennyAnd when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the houseSaying These last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the dayBut he answered one of them and said Friend I do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a pennyTake that thine is and go thy way I will give unto this last even as unto theeIs it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own Is thine eye evil because I am goodSo the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosenAnd Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto themBehold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to deathAnd shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise againThen came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of himAnd he said unto her What wilt thou She saith unto him Grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdomBut Jesus answered and said Ye know not what ye ask Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with They say unto him We are ableAnd he saith unto them Ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my FatherAnd when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethrenBut Jesus called them unto him and said Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon themBut it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your ministerAnd whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servantEven as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for manyAnd as they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed himAnd behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that Jesus passed by cried out saying Have mercy on us O Lord thou Son of DavidAnd the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying Have mercy on us O Lord thou Son of DavidAnd Jesus stood still and called them and said What will ye that I shall do unto youThey say unto him Lord that our eyes may be openedSo Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed himAnd when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage unto the mount of Olives then sent Jesus two disciplesSaying unto them Go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto meAnd if any man say ought unto you ye shall say The Lord hath need of them and straightway he will send themAll this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet sayingTell ye the daughter of Sion Behold thy King cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an assAnd the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded themAnd brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereonAnd a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the wayAnd the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna to the Son of David Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highestAnd when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying Who is thisAnd the multitude said This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of GalileeAnd Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold dovesAnd said unto them It is written My house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thievesAnd the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed themAnd when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying Hosanna to the Son of David they were sore displeasedAnd said unto him Hearest thou what these say And Jesus saith unto them Yea have ye never read Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praiseAnd he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and he lodged thereNow in the morning as he returned into the city he hungeredAnd when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever And presently the fig tree withered awayAnd when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying How soon is the fig tree withered awayJesus answered and said unto them Verily I say unto you If ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be doneAnd all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receiveAnd when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said By what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authorityAnd Jesus answered and said unto them I also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these thingsThe baptism of John whence was it from heaven or of men And they reasoned with themselves saying If we shall say From heaven he will say unto us Why did ye not then believe himBut if we shall say Of men we fear the people for all hold John as a prophetAnd they answered Jesus and said We cannot tell And he said unto them Neither tell I you by what authority I do these thingsBut what think ye A certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work to day in my vineyardHe answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and wentAnd he came to the second and said likewise And he answered and said I go sir and went notWhether of them twain did the will of his father They say unto him The first Jesus saith unto them Verily I say unto you That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before youFor John came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe himHear another parable There was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far countryAnd when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of itAnd the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned anotherAgain he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewiseBut last of all he sent unto them his son saying They will reverence my sonBut when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves This is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritanceAnd they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew himWhen the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmenThey say unto him He will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasonsJesus saith unto them Did ye never read in the scriptures The stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyesTherefore say I unto you The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereofAnd whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powderAnd when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of themBut when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophetAnd Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and saidThe kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his sonAnd sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not comeAgain he sent forth other servants saying Tell them which are bidden Behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriageBut they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandiseAnd the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew themBut when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their cityThen saith he to his servants The wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthyGo ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriageSo those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guestsAnd when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garmentAnd he saith unto him Friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment And he was speechlessThen said the king to the servants Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teethFor many are called but few are chosenThen went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talkAnd they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians saying Master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of menTell us therefore What thinkest thou Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or notBut Jesus perceived their wickedness and said Why tempt ye me ye hypocritesShew me the tribute money And they brought unto him a pennyAnd he saith unto them Whose is this image and superscriptionThey say unto him Caesars Then saith he unto them Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are GodsWhen they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their wayThe same day came to him the Sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked himSaying Master Moses said If a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brotherNow there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brotherLikewise the second also and the third unto the seventhAnd last of all the woman died alsoTherefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had herJesus answered and said unto them Ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of GodFor in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heavenBut as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God sayingI am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the livingAnd when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrineBut when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered togetherThen one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and sayingMaster which is the great commandment in the lawJesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mindThis is the first and great commandmentAnd the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyselfOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophetsWhile the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked themSaying What think ye of Christ whose son is he They say unto him The Son of DavidHe saith unto them How then doth David in spirit call him Lord sayingThe LORD said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstoolIf David then call him Lord how is he his sonAnd no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questionsThen spake Jesus to the multitude and to his disciplesSaying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seatAll therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do notFor they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingersBut all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garmentsAnd love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagoguesAnd greetings in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi RabbiBut be not ye called Rabbi for one is your Master even Christ and all ye are brethrenAnd call no man your father upon the earth for one is your Father which is in heavenNeither be ye called masters for one is your Master even ChristBut he that is greatest among you shall be your servantAnd whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exaltedBut woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go inWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnationWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselvesWoe unto you ye blind guides which say Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtorYe fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the goldAnd Whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guiltyYe fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the giftWhoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereonAnd whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth thereinAnd he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by him that sitteth thereonWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undoneYe blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camelWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excessThou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean alsoWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleannessEven so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquityWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteousAnd say If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophetsWherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophetsFill ye up then the measure of your fathersYe serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hellWherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to cityThat upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altarVerily I say unto you All these things shall come upon this generationO Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would notBehold your house is left unto you desolateFor I say unto you Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LordAnd Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the templeAnd Jesus said unto them See ye not all these things verily I say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown downAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying Tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the worldAnd Jesus answered and said unto them Take heed that no man deceive youFor many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive manyAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yetFor nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers placesAll these are the beginning of sorrowsThen shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sakeAnd then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one anotherAnd many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive manyAnd because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax coldBut he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be savedAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end comeWhen ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understandThen let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountainsLet him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his houseNeither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothesAnd woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those daysBut pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath dayFor then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall beAnd except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortenedThen if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it notFor there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very electBehold I have told you beforeWherefore if they shall say unto you Behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it notFor as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man beFor wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered togetherImmediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shakenAnd then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great gloryAnd he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the otherNow learn a parable of the fig tree When his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nighSo likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doorsVerily I say unto you This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilledHeaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass awayBut of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my Father onlyBut as the days of Noe were so shall also the coming of the Son of man beFor as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noe entered into the arkAnd knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the Son of man beThen shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other leftTwo women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other leftWatch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth comeBut know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken upTherefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man comethWho then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due seasonBlessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doingVerily I say unto you That he shall make him ruler over all his goodsBut and if that evil servant shall say in his heart My lord delayeth his comingAnd shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunkenThe lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware ofAnd shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teethThen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroomAnd five of them were wise and five were foolishThey that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with themBut the wise took oil in their vessels with their lampsWhile the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and sleptAnd at midnight there was a cry made Behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet himThen all those virgins arose and trimmed their lampsAnd the foolish said unto the wise Give us of your oil for our lamps are gone outBut the wise answered saying Not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselvesAnd while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shutAfterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to usBut he answered and said Verily I say unto you I know you notWatch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comethFor the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goodsAnd unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journeyThen he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talentsAnd likewise he that had received two he also gained other twoBut he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords moneyAfter a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with themAnd so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold I have gained beside them five talents moreHis lord said unto him Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lordHe also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents beside themHis lord said unto him Well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lordThen he which had received the one talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawedAnd I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thineHis lord answered and said unto him Thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not and gather where I have not strawedThou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usuryTake therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talentsFor unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hathAnd cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teethWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his gloryAnd before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goatsAnd he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the leftThen shall the King say unto them on his right hand Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the worldFor I was an hungred and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me inNaked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came unto meThen shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drinkWhen saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed theeOr when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto theeAnd the King shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto meThen shall he say also unto them on the left hand Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angelsFor I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat I was thirsty and ye gave me no drinkI was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me notThen shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto theeThen shall he answer them saying Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to meAnd these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternalAnd it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciplesYe know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucifiedThen assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called CaiaphasAnd consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty and kill himBut they said Not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the peopleNow when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leperThere came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meatBut when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying To what purpose is this wasteFor this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poorWhen Jesus understood it he said unto them Why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon meFor ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not alwaysFor in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burialVerily I say unto you Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of herThen one of the twelve called Judas Iscariot went unto the chief priestsAnd said unto them What will ye give me and I will deliver him unto you And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silverAnd from that time he sought opportunity to betray himNow the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passoverAnd he said Go into the city to such a man and say unto him The Master saith My time is at hand I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciplesAnd the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passoverNow when the even was come he sat down with the twelveAnd as they did eat he said Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray meAnd they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him Lord is it IAnd he answered and said He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray meThe Son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been bornThen Judas which betrayed him answered and said Master is it I He said unto him Thou hast saidAnd as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is my bodyAnd he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying Drink ye all of itFor this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sinsBut I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdomAnd when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of OlivesThen saith Jesus unto them All ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroadBut after I am risen again I will go before you into GalileePeter answered and said unto him Though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offendedJesus said unto him Verily I say unto thee That this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thricePeter said unto him Though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee Likewise also said all the disciplesThen cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples Sit ye here while I go and pray yonderAnd he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavyThen saith he unto them My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with meAnd he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wiltAnd he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter What could ye not watch with me one hourWatch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weakHe went away again the second time and prayed saying O my Father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be doneAnd he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavyAnd he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same wordsThen cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them Sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinnersRise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray meAnd while he yet spake lo Judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the peopleNow he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying Whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he hold him fastAnd forthwith he came to Jesus and said Hail master and kissed himAnd Jesus said unto him Friend wherefore art thou come Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took himAnd behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his earThen said Jesus unto him Put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the swordThinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angelsBut how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must beIn that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on meBut all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples forsook him and fledAnd they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembledBut Peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the endNow the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus to put him to deathBut found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none At the last came two false witnessesAnd said This fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three daysAnd the high priest arose and said unto him Answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against theeBut Jesus held his peace And the high priest answered and said unto him I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the Son of GodJesus saith unto him Thou hast said nevertheless I say unto you Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heavenThen the high priest rent his clothes saying He hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemyWhat think ye They answered and said He is guilty of deathThen did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their handsSaying Prophesy unto us thou Christ Who is he that smote theeNow Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying Thou also wast with Jesus of GalileeBut he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayestAnd when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there This fellow was also with Jesus of NazarethAnd again he denied with an oath I do not know the manAnd after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter Surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth theeThen began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man And immediately the cock crewAnd Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice And he went out and wept bitterlyWhen the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to deathAnd when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governorThen Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and eldersSaying I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood And they said What is that to us see thou to thatAnd he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himselfAnd the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of bloodAnd they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers inWherefore that field was called The field of blood unto this dayThen was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet saying And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of Israel did valueAnd gave them for the potters field as the Lord appointed meAnd Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying Art thou the King of the Jews And Jesus said unto him Thou sayestAnd when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothingThen said Pilate unto him Hearest thou not how many things they witness against theeAnd he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatlyNow at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they wouldAnd they had then a notable prisoner called BarabbasTherefore when they were gathered together Pilate said unto them Whom will ye that I release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which is called ChristFor he knew that for envy they had delivered himWhen he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying Have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of himBut the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and destroy JesusThe governor answered and said unto them Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you They said BarabbasPilate saith unto them What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ They all say unto him Let him be crucifiedAnd the governor said Why what evil hath he done But they cried out the more saying Let him be crucifiedWhen Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to itThen answered all the people and said His blood be on us and on our childrenThen released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucifiedThen the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiersAnd they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robeAnd when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying Hail King of the JewsAnd they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the headAnd after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify himAnd as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his crossAnd when they were come unto a place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skullThey gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drinkAnd they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet They parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lotsAnd sitting down they watched him thereAnd set up over his head his accusation written THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWSThen were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the leftAnd they that passed by reviled him wagging their headsAnd saying Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself If thou be the Son of God come down from the crossLikewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders saidHe saved others himself he cannot save If he be the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe himHe trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the Son of GodThe thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teethNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hourAnd about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say My God my God why hast thou forsaken meSome of them that stood there when they heard that said This man calleth for EliasAnd straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drinkThe rest said Let be let us see whether Elias will come to save himJesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghostAnd behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rentAnd the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept aroseAnd came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto manyNow when the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying Truly this was the Son of GodAnd many women were there beholding afar off which followed Jesus from Galilee ministering unto himAmong which was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of Zebedees childrenWhen the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus discipleHe went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus Then Pilate commanded the body to be deliveredAnd when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen clothAnd laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departedAnd there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchreNow the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto PilateSaying Sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive After three days I will rise againCommand therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people He is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the firstPilate said unto them Ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye canSo they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watchIn the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchreAnd behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon itHis countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snowAnd for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead menAnd the angel answered and said unto the women Fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucifiedHe is not here for he is risen as he said Come see the place where the Lord layAnd go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told youAnd they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples wordAnd as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying All hail And they came and held him by the feet and worshipped himThen said Jesus unto them Be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see meNow when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were doneAnd when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiersSaying Say ye His disciples came by night and stole him away while we sleptAnd if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure youSo they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this dayThen the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed themAnd when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubtedAnd Jesus came and spake unto them saying All power is given unto me in heaven and in earthGo ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy GhostTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world AmenThe beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of GodAs it is written in the prophets Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before theeThe voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straightJohn did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sinsAnd there went out unto him all the land of Judaea and they of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan confessing their sinsAnd John was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honeyAnd preached saying There cometh one mightier than I after me the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unlooseI indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy GhostAnd it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John in JordanAnd straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending upon himAnd there came a voice from heaven saying Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleasedAnd immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wildernessAnd he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto himNow after that John was put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of GodAnd saying The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and believe the gospelNow as he walked by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishersAnd Jesus said unto them Come ye after me and I will make you to become fishers of menAnd straightway they forsook their nets and followed himAnd when he had gone a little further thence he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who also were in the ship mending their netsAnd straightway he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after himAnd they went into Capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taughtAnd they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribesAnd there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried outSaying Let us alone what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth art thou come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of GodAnd Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and come out of himAnd when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of himAnd they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying What thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey himAnd immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about GalileeAnd forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and JohnBut Simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of herAnd he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto themAnd at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devilsAnd all the city was gathered together at the doorAnd he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew himAnd in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayedAnd Simon and they that were with him followed after himAnd when they had found him they said unto him All men seek for theeAnd he said unto them Let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also for therefore came I forthAnd he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out devilsAnd there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him If thou wilt thou canst make me cleanAnd Jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him I will be thou cleanAnd as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansedAnd he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him awayAnd saith unto him See thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded for a testimony unto themBut he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarterAnd again he entered into Capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the houseAnd straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto themAnd they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was borne of fourAnd when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy layWhen Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy Son thy sins be forgiven theeBut there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their heartsWhy doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but God onlyAnd immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them Why reason ye these things in your heartsWhether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say Arise and take up thy bed and walkBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsyI say unto thee Arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine houseAnd immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified God saying We never saw it on this fashionAnd he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught themAnd as he passed by he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him Follow me And he arose and followed himAnd it came to pass that as Jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed himAnd when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinnersWhen Jesus heard it he saith unto them They that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentanceAnd the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast notAnd Jesus said unto them Can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fastBut the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those daysNo man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worseAnd no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottlesAnd it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of cornAnd the Pharisees said unto him Behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawfulAnd he said unto them Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was an hungred he and they that were with himHow he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them which were with himAnd he said unto them The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbathTherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbathAnd he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered handAnd they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse himAnd he saith unto the man which had the withered hand Stand forthAnd he saith unto them Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill But they held their peaceAnd when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man Stretch forth thine hand And he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the otherAnd the Pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him how they might destroy himBut Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from Galilee followed him and from JudaeaAnd from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond Jordan and they about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude when they had heard what great things he did came unto himAnd he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng himFor he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plaguesAnd unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying Thou art the Son of GodAnd he straitly charged them that they should not make him knownAnd he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto himAnd he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preachAnd to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devilsAnd Simon he surnamed PeterAnd James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James and he surnamed them Boanerges which is The sons of thunderAnd Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the CanaaniteAnd Judas Iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an houseAnd the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat breadAnd when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said He is beside himselfAnd the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said He hath Beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devilsAnd he called them unto him and said unto them in parables How can Satan cast out SatanAnd if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot standAnd if a house be divided against itself that house cannot standAnd if Satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an endNo man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his houseVerily I say unto you All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blasphemeBut he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnationBecause they said He hath an unclean spiritThere came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling himAnd the multitude sat about him and they said unto him Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for theeAnd he answered them saying Who is my mother or my brethrenAnd he looked round about on them which sat about him and said Behold my mother and my brethrenFor whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and motherAnd he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the landAnd he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrineHearken Behold there went out a sower to sowAnd it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it upAnd some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earthBut when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered awayAnd some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruitAnd other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundredAnd he said unto them He that hath ears to hear let him hearAnd when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parableAnd he said unto them Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parablesThat seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven themAnd he said unto them Know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parablesThe sower soweth the wordAnd these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their heartsAnd these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladnessAnd have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offendedAnd these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the wordAnd the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitfulAnd these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundredAnd he said unto them Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestickFor there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroadIf any man have ears to hear let him hearAnd he said unto them Take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be givenFor he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hathAnd he said So is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the groundAnd should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not howFor the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the earBut when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is comeAnd he said Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God or with what comparison shall we compare itIt is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earthBut when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of itAnd with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear itBut without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciplesAnd the same day when the even was come he saith unto them Let us pass over unto the other sideAnd when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship And there were also with him other little shipsAnd there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now fullAnd he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perishAnd he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea Peace be still And the wind ceased and there was a great calmAnd he said unto them Why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faithAnd they feared exceedingly and said one to another What manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey himAnd they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the GadarenesAnd when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spiritWho had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chainsBecause that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame himAnd always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stonesBut when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped himAnd cried with a loud voice and said What have I to do with thee Jesus thou Son of the most high God I adjure thee by God that thou torment me notFor he said unto him Come out of the man thou unclean spiritAnd he asked him What is thy name And he answered saying My name is Legion for we are manyAnd he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the countryNow there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feedingAnd all the devils besought him saying Send us into the swine that we may enter into themAnd forthwith Jesus gave them leave And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the seaAnd they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country And they went out to see what it was that was doneAnd they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraidAnd they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swineAnd they began to pray him to depart out of their coastsAnd when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with himHowbeit Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him Go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on theeAnd he departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvelAnd when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the seaAnd behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feetAnd besought him greatly saying My little daughter lieth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall liveAnd Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged himAnd a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve yearsAnd had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worseWhen she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched his garmentFor she said If I may touch but his clothes I shall be wholeAnd straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plagueAnd Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said Who touched my clothesAnd his disciples said unto him Thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou Who touched meAnd he looked round about to see her that had done this thingBut the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truthAnd he said unto her Daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plagueWhile he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said Thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the Master any furtherAs soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not afraid only believeAnd he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John the brother of JamesAnd he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatlyAnd when he was come in he saith unto them Why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepethAnd they laughed him to scorn But when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lyingAnd he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her Talitha cumi which is being interpreted Damsel I say unto thee ariseAnd straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years And they were astonished with a great astonishmentAnd he charged them straitly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eatAnd he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow himAnd when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying From whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his handsIs not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and Joses and of Juda and Simon and are not his sisters here with us And they were offended at himBut Jesus said unto them A prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own houseAnd he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed themAnd he marvelled because of their unbelief And he went round about the villages teachingAnd he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spiritsAnd commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purseBut be shod with sandals and not put on two coatsAnd he said unto them In what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that placeAnd whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them Verily I say unto you It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that cityAnd they went out and preached that men should repentAnd they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed themAnd king Herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said That John the Baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in himOthers said That it is Elias And others said That it is a prophet or as one of the prophetsBut when Herod heard thereof he said It is John whom I beheaded he is risen from the deadFor Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for Herodias sake his brother Philips wife for he had married herFor John had said unto Herod It is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wifeTherefore Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could notFor Herod feared John knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladlyAnd when a convenient day was come that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of GalileeAnd when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it theeAnd he sware unto her Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me I will give it thee unto the half of my kingdomAnd she went forth and said unto her mother What shall I ask And she said The head of John the BaptistAnd she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the BaptistAnd the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject herAnd immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prisonAnd brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her motherAnd when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tombAnd the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taughtAnd he said unto them Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eatAnd they departed into a desert place by ship privatelyAnd the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto himAnd Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many thingsAnd when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said This is a desert place and now the time is far passedSend them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eatHe answered and said unto them Give ye them to eat And they say unto him Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eatHe saith unto them How many loaves have ye go and see And when they knew they say Five and two fishesAnd he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grassAnd they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fiftiesAnd when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them allAnd they did all eat and were filledAnd they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishesAnd they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand menAnd straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida while he sent away the peopleAnd when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to prayAnd when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the landAnd he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by themBut when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried outFor they all saw him and were troubled And immediately he talked with them and saith unto them Be of good cheer it is I be not afraidAnd he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wonderedFor they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardenedAnd when they had passed over they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shoreAnd when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew himAnd ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he wasAnd whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made wholeThen came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from JerusalemAnd when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashen hands they found faultFor the Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the eldersAnd when they come from the market except they wash they eat not And many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tablesThen the Pharisees and scribes asked him Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen handsHe answered and said unto them Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written This people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from meHowbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctines the commandments of menFor laying aside the commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye doAnd he said unto them Full well ye reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own traditionFor Moses said Honour thy father and thy mother and Whoso curseth father or mother let him die the deathBut ye say If a man shall say to his father or mother It is Corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be freeAnd ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his motherMaking the word of God of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do yeAnd when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them Hearken unto me every one of you and understandThere is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the manIf any man have ears to hear let him hearAnd when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parableAnd he saith unto them Are ye so without understanding also Do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile himBecause it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all meatsAnd he said That which cometh out of the man that defileth the manFor from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murdersThefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishnessAll these evil things come from within and defile the manAnd from thence he arose and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hidFor a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feetThe woman was a Greek a Syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughterBut Jesus said unto her Let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the dogsAnd she answered and said unto him Yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbsAnd he said unto her For this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughterAnd when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bedAnd again departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon he came unto the sea of Galilee through the midst of the coasts of DecapolisAnd they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon himAnd he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongueAnd looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him Ephphatha that is Be openedAnd straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plainAnd he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published itAnd were beyond measure astonished saying He hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speakIn those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto themI have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eatAnd if I send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from farAnd his disciples answered him From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wildernessAnd he asked them How many loaves have ye And they said SevenAnd he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the peopleAnd they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before themSo they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven basketsAnd they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them awayAnd straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of DalmanuthaAnd the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting himAnd he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith Why doth this generation seek after a sign verily I say unto you There shall no sign be given unto this generationAnd he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other sideNow the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loafAnd he charged them saying Take heed beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of HerodAnd they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have no breadAnd when Jesus knew it he saith unto them Why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardenedHaving eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not rememberWhen I brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up They say unto him TwelveAnd when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up And they said SevenAnd he said unto them How is it that ye do not understandAnd he cometh to Bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch himAnd he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw oughtAnd he looked up and said I see men as trees walkingAfter that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearlyAnd he sent him away to his house saying Neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the townAnd Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them Whom do men say that I amAnd they answered John the Baptist but some say Elias and others One of the prophetsAnd he saith unto them But whom say ye that I am And Peter answereth and saith unto him Thou art the ChristAnd he charged them that they should tell no man of himAnd he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise againAnd he spake that saying openly And Peter took him and began to rebuke himBut when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying Get thee behind me Satan for thou savourest not the things that be of God but the things that be of menAnd when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them Whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow meFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save itFor what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soulOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soulWhosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angelsAnd he said unto them Verily I say unto you That there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with powerAnd after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before themAnd his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white themAnd there appeared unto them Elias with Moses and they were talking with JesusAnd Peter answered and said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for EliasFor he wist not what to say for they were sore afraidAnd there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son hear himAnd suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man any more save Jesus only with themselvesAnd as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the Son of man were risen from the deadAnd they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should meanAnd they asked him saying Why say the scribes that Elias must first comeAnd he answered and told them Elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the Son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at noughtBut I say unto you That Elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of himAnd when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with themAnd straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted himAnd he asked the scribes What question ye with themAnd one of the multitude answered and said Master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spiritAnd wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could notHe answereth him and saith O faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto meAnd they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foamingAnd he asked his father How long is it ago since this came unto him And he said Of a childAnd ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us and help usJesus said unto him If thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believethAnd straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbeliefWhen Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him Thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into himAnd the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said He is deadBut Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he aroseAnd when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately Why could not we cast him outAnd he said unto them This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fastingAnd they departed thence and passed through Galilee and he would not that any man should know itFor he taught his disciples and said unto them The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third dayBut they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask himAnd he came to Capernaum and being in the house he asked them What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the wayBut they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatestAnd he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them If any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of allAnd he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto themWhosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent meAnd John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not usBut Jesus said Forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of meFor he that is not against us is on our partFor whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his rewardAnd whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the seaAnd if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenchedWhere their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenchedAnd if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenchedWhere their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenchedAnd if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fireWhere their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenchedFor every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with saltSalt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it Have salt in yourselves and have peace one with anotherAnd he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them againAnd the Pharisees came to him and asked him Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting himAnd he answered and said unto them What did Moses command youAnd they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her awayAnd Jesus answered and said unto them For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this preceptBut from the beginning of the creation God made them male and femaleFor this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wifeAnd they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one fleshWhat therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunderAnd in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matterAnd he saith unto them Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against herAnd if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adulteryAnd they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought themBut when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of GodVerily I say unto you Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter thereinAnd he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed themAnd when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him Good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal lifeAnd Jesus said unto him Why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is GodThou knowest the commandments Do not commit adultery Do not kill Do not steal Do not bear false witness Defraud not Honour thy father and motherAnd he answered and said unto him Master all these have I observed from my youthThen Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him One thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow meAnd he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessionsAnd Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of GodAnd the disciples were astonished at his words But Jesus answereth again and saith unto them Children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of GodIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of GodAnd they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves Who then can be savedAnd Jesus looking upon them saith With men it is impossible but not with God for with God all things are possibleThen Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed theeAnd Jesus answered and said Verily I say unto you There is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospelsBut he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal lifeBut many that are first shall be last and the last firstAnd they were in the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid And he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto himSaying Behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the GentilesAnd they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise againAnd James and John the sons of Zebedee come unto him saying Master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desireAnd he said unto them What would ye that I should do for youThey said unto him Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy gloryBut Jesus said unto them Ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized withAnd they said unto him We can And Jesus said unto them Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptizedBut to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is preparedAnd when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with James and JohnBut Jesus called them to him and saith unto them Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon themBut so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your ministerAnd whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of allFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for manyAnd they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus sat by the highway side beggingAnd when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou Son of David have mercy on meAnd many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal Thou Son of David have mercy on meAnd Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called And they call the blind man saying unto him Be of good comfort rise he calleth theeAnd he casting away his garment rose and came to JesusAnd Jesus answered and said unto him What wilt thou that I should do unto thee The blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sightAnd Jesus said unto him Go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the wayAnd when they came nigh to Jerusalem unto Bethphage and Bethany at the mount of Olives he sendeth forth two of his disciplesAnd saith unto them Go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring himAnd if any man say unto you Why do ye this say ye that the Lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hitherAnd they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose himAnd certain of them that stood there said unto them What do ye loosing the coltAnd they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded and they let them goAnd they brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon himAnd many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the wayAnd they that went before and they that followed cried saying Hosanna Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LordBlessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highestAnd Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was come he went out unto Bethany with the twelveAnd on the morrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungryAnd seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yetAnd Jesus answered and said unto it No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever And his disciples heard itAnd they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold dovesAnd would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the templeAnd he taught saying unto them Is it not written My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thievesAnd the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrineAnd when even was come he went out of the cityAnd in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the rootsAnd Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him Master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered awayAnd Jesus answering saith unto them Have faith in GodFor verily I say unto you That whosoever shall say unto this mountain Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saithTherefore I say unto you What things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have themAnd when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespassesBut if ye do not forgive neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespassesAnd they come again to Jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the eldersAnd say unto him By what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these thingsAnd Jesus answered and said unto them I will also ask of you one question and answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these thingsThe baptism of John was it from heaven or of men answer meAnd they reasoned with themselves saying If we shall say From heaven he will say Why then did ye not believe himBut if we shall say Of men they feared the people for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeedAnd they answered and said unto Jesus We cannot tell And Jesus answering saith unto them Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these thingsAnd he began to speak unto them by parables A certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far countryAnd at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyardAnd they caught him and beat him and sent him away emptyAnd again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handledAnd again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing someHaving yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying They will reverence my sonBut those husbandmen said among themselves This is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be oursAnd they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyardWhat shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto othersAnd have ye not read this scripture The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the cornerThis was the Lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyesAnd they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their wayAnd they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in his wordsAnd when they were come they say unto him Master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of God in truth Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or notShall we give or shall we not give But he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them Why tempt ye me bring me a penny that I may see itAnd they brought it And he saith unto them Whose is this image and superscription And they said unto him CaesarsAnd Jesus answering said unto them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods And they marvelled at himThen come unto him the Sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him sayingMaster Moses wrote unto us If a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brotherNow there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seedAnd the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewiseAnd the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died alsoIn the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wifeAnd Jesus answering said unto them Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of GodFor when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heavenAnd as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spake unto him saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of JacobHe is not the God of the dead but the God of the living ye therefore do greatly errAnd one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him Which is the first commandment of allAnd Jesus answered him The first of all the commandments is Hear O Israel The Lord our God is one LordAnd thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandmentAnd the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself There is none other commandment greater than theseAnd the scribe said unto him Well Master thou hast said the truth for there is one God and there is none other but heAnd to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrificesAnd when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him Thou art not far from the kingdom of God And no man after that durst ask him any questionAnd Jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of DavidFor David himself said by the Holy Ghost The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstoolDavid therefore himself calleth him Lord and whence is he then his son And the common people heard him gladlyAnd he said unto them in his doctrine Beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplacesAnd the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feastsWhich devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnationAnd Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in muchAnd there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthingAnd he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them Verily I say unto you That this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasuryFor all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her livingAnd as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him Master see what manner of stones and what buildings are hereAnd Jesus answering said unto him Seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown downAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privatelyTell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilledAnd Jesus answering them began to say Take heed lest any man deceive youFor many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive manyAnd when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yetFor nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrowsBut take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against themAnd the gospel must first be published among all nationsBut when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the Holy GhostNow the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to deathAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be savedBut when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountainsAnd let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his houseAnd let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garmentBut woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those daysAnd pray ye that your flight be not in the winterFor in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time neither shall beAnd except that the Lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the daysAnd then if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or lo he is there believe him notFor false Christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the electBut take ye heed behold I have foretold you all thingsBut in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her lightAnd the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shakenAnd then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and gloryAnd then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heavenNow learn a parable of the fig tree When her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nearSo ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doorsVerily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be doneHeaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass awayBut of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the Son but the FatherTake ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time isFor the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watchWatch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morningLest coming suddenly he find you sleepingAnd what I say unto you I say unto all WatchAfter two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to deathBut they said Not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the peopleAnd being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his headAnd there were some that had indignation within themselves and said Why was this waste of the ointment madeFor it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor And they murmured against herAnd Jesus said Let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on meFor ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not alwaysShe hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the buryingVerily I say unto you Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of herAnd Judas Iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto themAnd when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money And he sought how he might conveniently betray himAnd the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passoverAnd he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them Go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow himAnd wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house The Master saith Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciplesAnd he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for usAnd his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passoverAnd in the evening he cometh with the twelveAnd as they sat and did eat Jesus said Verily I say unto you One of you which eateth with me shall betray meAnd they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one Is it I and another said Is it IAnd he answered and said unto them It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dishThe Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been bornAnd as they did eat Jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and gave to them and said Take eat this is my bodyAnd he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of itAnd he said unto them This is my blood of the new testament which is shed for manyVerily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of GodAnd when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of OlivesAnd Jesus saith unto them All ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scatteredBut after that I am risen I will go before you into GalileeBut Peter said unto him Although all shall be offended yet will not IAnd Jesus saith unto him Verily I say unto thee That this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thriceBut he spake the more vehemently If I should die with thee I will not deny thee in any wise Likewise also said they allAnd they came to a place which was named Gethsemane and he saith to his disciples Sit ye here while I shall prayAnd he taketh with him Peter and James and John and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavyAnd saith unto them My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watchAnd he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from himAnd he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thou wiltAnd he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hourWatch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation The spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weakAnd again he went away and prayed and spake the same wordsAnd when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer himAnd he cometh the third time and saith unto them Sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinnersRise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at handAnd immediately while he yet spake cometh Judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the eldersAnd he that betrayed him had given them a token saying Whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away safelyAnd as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith Master master and kissed himAnd they laid their hands on him and took himAnd one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his earAnd Jesus answered and said unto them Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take meI was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilledAnd they all forsook him and fledAnd there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on himAnd he left the linen cloth and fled from them nakedAnd they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribesAnd Peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fireAnd the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death and found noneFor many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not togetherAnd there arose certain and bare false witness against him sayingWe heard him say I will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days I will build another made without handsBut neither so did their witness agree togetherAnd the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying Answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against theeBut he held his peace and answered nothing Again the high priest asked him and said unto him Art thou the Christ the Son of the BlessedAnd Jesus said I am and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heavenThen the high priest rent his clothes and saith What need we any further witnessesYe have heard the blasphemy what think ye And they all condemned him to be guilty of deathAnd some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him Prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their handsAnd as Peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priestAnd when she saw Peter warming himself she looked upon him and said And thou also wast with Jesus of NazarethBut he denied saying I know not neither understand I what thou sayest And he went out into the porch and the cock crewAnd a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by This is one of themAnd he denied it again And a little after they that stood by said again to Peter Surely thou art one of them for thou art a Galilaean and thy speech agreeth theretoBut he began to curse and to swear saying I know not this man of whom ye speakAnd the second time the cock crew And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice And when he thought thereon he weptAnd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him to PilateAnd Pilate asked him Art thou the King of the Jews And he answering said unto him Thou sayest itAnd the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothingAnd Pilate asked him again saying Answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against theeBut Jesus yet answered nothing so that Pilate marvelledNow at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desiredAnd there was one named Barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrectionAnd the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto themBut Pilate answered them saying Will ye that I release unto you the King of the JewsFor he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envyBut the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas unto themAnd Pilate answered and said again unto them What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the JewsAnd they cried out again Crucify himThen Pilate said unto them Why what evil hath he done And they cried out the more exceedingly Crucify himAnd so Pilate willing to content the people released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus when he had scourged him to be crucifiedAnd the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium and they call together the whole bandAnd they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his headAnd began to salute him Hail King of the JewsAnd they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped himAnd when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify himAnd they compel one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his crossAnd they bring him unto the place Golgotha which is being interpreted The place of a skullAnd they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it notAnd when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should takeAnd it was the third hour and they crucified himAnd the superscription of his accusation was written over THE KING OF THE JEWSAnd with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his leftAnd the scripture was fulfilled which saith And he was numbered with the transgressorsAnd they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying Ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three daysSave thyself and come down from the crossLikewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes He saved others himself he cannot saveLet Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe And they that were crucified with him reviled himAnd when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hourAnd at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted My God my God why hast thou forsaken meAnd some of them that stood by when they heard it said Behold he calleth EliasAnd one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying Let alone let us see whether Elias will come to take him downAnd Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghostAnd the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottomAnd when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said Truly this man was the Son of GodThere were also women looking on afar off among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses and SalomeWho also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto JerusalemAnd now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbathJoseph of Arimathaea and honourable counseller which also waited for the kingdom of God came and went in boldly unto Pilate and craved the body of JesusAnd Pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while deadAnd when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to JosephAnd he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchreAnd Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laidAnd when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint himAnd very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sunAnd they said among themselves Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchreAnd when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very greatAnd entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrightedAnd he saith unto them Be not affrighted Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid himBut go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto youAnd they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraidNow when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devilsAnd she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and weptAnd they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed notAfter that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the countryAnd they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they themAfterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risenAnd he said unto them Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creatureHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damnedAnd these signs shall follow them that believe In my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tonguesThey shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recoverSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of GodAnd they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following AmenForasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among usEven as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the wordIt seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent TheophilusThat thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructedThere was in the days of Herod the king of Judaea a certain priest named Zacharias of the course of Abia and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was ElisabethAnd they were both righteous before God walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessAnd they had no child because that Elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in yearsAnd it came to pass that while he executed the priests office before God in the order of his courseAccording to the custom of the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the LordAnd the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incenseAnd there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incenseAnd when Zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon himBut the angel said unto him Fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name JohnAnd thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birthFor he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mothers wombAnd many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their GodAnd he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the LordAnd Zacharias said unto the angel Whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in yearsAnd the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidingsAnd behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their seasonAnd the people waited for Zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the templeAnd when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechlessAnd it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own houseAnd after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months sayingThus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among menAnd in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named NazarethTo a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgins name was MaryAnd the angel came in unto her and said Hail thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among womenAnd when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should beAnd the angel said unto her Fear not Mary for thou hast found favour with GodAnd behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name JESUSHe shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father DavidAnd he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no endThen said Mary unto the angel How shall this be seeing I know not a manAnd the angel answered and said unto her The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of GodAnd behold thy cousin Elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barrenFor with God nothing shall be impossibleAnd Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word And the angel departed from herAnd Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of JudaAnd entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted ElisabethAnd it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary the babe leaped in her womb and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy GhostAnd she spake out with a loud voice and said Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy wombAnd whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to meFor lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joyAnd blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the LordAnd Mary said My soul doth magnify the LordAnd my spirit hath rejoiced in God my SaviourFor he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessedFor he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his nameAnd his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generationHe hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heartsHe hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degreeHe hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty awayHe hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercyAs he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed for everAnd Mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own houseNow Elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a sonAnd her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with herAnd it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him Zacharias after the name of his fatherAnd his mother answered and said Not so but he shall be called JohnAnd they said unto her There is none of thy kindred that is called by this nameAnd they made signs to his father how he would have him calledAnd he asked for a writing table and wrote saying His name is John And they marvelled allAnd his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised GodAnd fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of JudaeaAnd all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying What manner of child shall this be And the hand of the Lord was with himAnd his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied sayingBlessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his peopleAnd hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant DavidAs he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world beganThat we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate usTo perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenantThe oath which he sware to our father AbrahamThat he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fearIn holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our lifeAnd thou child shalt be called the prophet of the Highest for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his waysTo give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sinsThrough the tender mercy of our God whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited usTo give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peaceAnd the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto IsraelAnd it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxedAnd this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of SyriaAnd all went to be taxed every one into his own cityAnd Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of DavidTo be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with childAnd so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be deliveredAnd she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the innAnd there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by nightAnd lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraidAnd the angel said unto them Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all peopleFor unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour which is Christ the LordAnd this shall be a sign unto you Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a mangerAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and sayingGlory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward menAnd it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto usAnd they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a mangerAnd when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this childAnd all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherdsBut Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heartAnd the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto themAnd when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called JESUS which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the wombAnd when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the LordAs it is written in the law of the Lord Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the LordAnd to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeonsAnd behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon himAnd it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lords ChristAnd he came by the Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the lawThen took he him up in his arms and blessed God and saidLord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy wordFor mine eyes have seen thy salvationWhich thou hast prepared before the face of all peopleA light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people IsraelAnd Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of himAnd Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother Behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken againstYea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealedAnd there was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginityAnd she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served God with fastings and prayers night and dayAnd she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in JerusalemAnd when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own city NazarethAnd the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon himNow his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passoverAnd when he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feastAnd when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of itBut they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintanceAnd when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking himAnd it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questionsAnd all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answersAnd when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him Son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowingAnd he said unto them How is it that ye sought me wist ye not that I must be about my Fathers businessAnd they understood not the saying which he spake unto themAnd he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heartAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and manNow in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis and Lysanias the tetrarch of AbileneAnnas and Caiaphas being the high priests the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wildernessAnd he came into all the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sinsAs it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet saying The voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straightEvery valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smoothAnd all flesh shall see the salvation of GodThen said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him O generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to comeBring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves We have Abraham to our father for I say unto you That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto AbrahamAnd now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fireAnd the people asked him saying What shall we do thenHe answereth and saith unto them He that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewiseThen came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him Master what shall we doAnd he said unto them Exact no more than that which is appointed youAnd the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying And what shall we do And he said unto them Do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wagesAnd as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or notJohn answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fireWhose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchableAnd many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the peopleBut Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philips wife and for all the evils which Herod had doneAdded yet this above all that he shut up John in prisonNow when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was openedAnd the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said Thou art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleasedAnd Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of Joseph which was the son of HeliWhich was the son of Matthat which was the son of Levi which was the son of Melchi which was the son of Janna which was the son of JosephWhich was the son of Mattathias which was the son of Amos which was the son of Naum which was the son of Esli which was the son of NaggeWhich was the son of Maath which was the son of Mattathias which was the son of Semei which was the son of Joseph which was the son of JudaWhich was the son of Joanna which was the son of Rhesa which was the son of Zorobabel which was the son of Salathiel which was the son of NeriWhich was the son of Melchi which was the son of Addi which was the son of Cosam which was the son of Elmodam which was the son of ErWhich was the son of Jose which was the son of Eliezer which was the son of Jorim which was the son of Matthat which was the son of LeviWhich was the son of Simeon which was the son of Juda which was the son of Joseph which was the son of Jonan which was the son of EliakimWhich was the son of Melea which was the son of Menan which was the son of Mattatha which was the son of Nathan which was the son of DavidWhich was the son of Jesse which was the son of Obed which was the son of Booz which was the son of Salmon which was the son of NaassonWhich was the son of Aminadab which was the son of Aram which was the son of Esrom which was the son of Phares which was the son of JudaWhich was the son of Jacob which was the son of Isaac which was the son of Abraham which was the son of Thara which was the son of NachorWhich was the son of Saruch which was the son of Ragau which was the son of Phalec which was the son of Heber which was the son of SalaWhich was the son of Cainan which was the son of Arphaxad which was the son of Sem which was the son of Noe which was the son of LamechWhich was the son of Mathusala which was the son of Enoch which was the son of Jared which was the son of Maleleel which was the son of CainanWhich was the son of Enos which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of GodAnd Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wildernessBeing forty days tempted of the devil And in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungeredAnd the devil said unto him If thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made breadAnd Jesus answered him saying It is written That man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of GodAnd the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of timeAnd the devil said unto him All this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give itIf thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thineAnd Jesus answered and said unto him Get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serveAnd he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him If thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from henceFor it is written He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep theeAnd in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stoneAnd Jesus answering said unto him It is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy GodAnd when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a seasonAnd Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round aboutAnd he taught in their synagogues being glorified of allAnd he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to readAnd there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias And when he had opened the book he found the place where it was writtenThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruisedTo preach the acceptable year of the LordAnd he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on himAnd he began to say unto them This day is this scripture fulfilled in your earsAnd all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth And they said Is not this Josephs sonAnd he said unto them Ye will surely say unto me this proverb Physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy countryAnd he said Verily I say unto you No prophet is accepted in his own countryBut I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the landBut unto none of them was Elias sent save unto Sarepta a city of Sidon unto a woman that was a widowAnd many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the SyrianAnd all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrathAnd rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlongBut he passing through the midst of them went his wayAnd came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee and taught them on the sabbath daysAnd they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with powerAnd in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voiceSaying Let us alone what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth art thou come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of GodAnd Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and come out of him And when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him notAnd they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying What a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come outAnd the fame of him went out into every place of the country round aboutAnd he arose out of the synagogue and entered into Simons house And Simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for herAnd he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto themNow when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed themAnd devils also came out of many crying out and saying Thou art Christ the Son of God And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was ChristAnd when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from themAnd he said unto them I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also for therefore am I sentAnd he preached in the synagogues of GalileeAnd it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of GennesaretAnd saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their netsAnd he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land And he sat down and taught the people out of the shipNow when he had left speaking he said unto Simon Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draughtAnd Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word I will let down the netAnd when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brakeAnd they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them And they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sinkWhen Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man O LordFor he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had takenAnd so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon And Jesus said unto Simon Fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch menAnd when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed himAnd it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on his face and besought him saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me cleanAnd he put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean And immediately the leprosy departed from himAnd he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded for a testimony unto themBut so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmitiesAnd he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayedAnd it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal themAnd behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before himAnd when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before JesusAnd when he saw their faith he said unto him Man thy sins are forgiven theeAnd the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying Who is this which speaketh blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God aloneBut when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them What reason ye in your heartsWhether is easier to say Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say Rise up and walkBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy I say unto thee Arise and take up thy couch and go into thine houseAnd immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying GodAnd they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying We have seen strange things to dayAnd after these things he went forth and saw a publican named Levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him Follow meAnd he left all rose up and followed himAnd Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with themBut their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples saying Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinnersAnd Jesus answering said unto them They that are whole need not a physician but they that are sickI came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentanceAnd they said unto him Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees but thine eat and drinkAnd he said unto them Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with themBut the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those daysAnd he spake also a parable unto them No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the oldAnd no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perishBut new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preservedNo man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for he saith The old is betterAnd it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their handsAnd certain of the Pharisees said unto them Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath daysAnd Jesus answering them said Have ye not read so much as this what David did when himself was an hungred and they which were with himHow he went into the house of God and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests aloneAnd he said unto them That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbathAnd it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was witheredAnd the scribes and Pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against himBut he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand Rise up and stand forth in the midst And he arose and stood forthThen said Jesus unto them I will ask you one thing Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy itAnd looking round about upon them all he said unto the man Stretch forth thy hand And he did so and his hand was restored whole as the otherAnd they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to JesusAnd it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to GodAnd when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of them he chose twelve whom also he named apostlesSimon whom he also named Peter and Andrew his brother James and John Philip and BartholomewMatthew and Thomas James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called ZelotesAnd Judas the brother of James and Judas Iscariot which also was the traitorAnd he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseasesAnd they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healedAnd the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them allAnd he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said Blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of GodBlessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled Blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laughBlessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the Son of mans sakeRejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophetsBut woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolationWoe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger Woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weepWoe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophetsBut I say unto you which hear Love your enemies do good to them which hate youBless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use youAnd unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat alsoGive to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not againAnd as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewiseFor if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love themAnd if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the sameAnd if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much againBut love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the Highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evilBe ye therefore merciful as your Father also is mercifulJudge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgivenGive and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you againAnd he spake a parable unto them Can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditchThe disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his masterAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eyeEither how canst thou say to thy brother Brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye Thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eyeFor a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruitFor every tree is known by his own fruit For of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapesA good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speakethAnd why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I sayWhosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will shew you to whom he is likeHe is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rockBut he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was greatNow when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into CapernaumAnd a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to dieAnd when he heard of Jesus he sent unto him the elders of the Jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servantAnd when they came to Jesus they besought him instantly saying That he was worthy for whom he should do thisFor he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogueThen Jesus went with them And when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him Lord trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roofWherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healedFor I also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and I say unto one Go and he goeth and to another Come and he cometh and to my servant Do this and he doeth itWhen Jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in IsraelAnd they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sickAnd it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called Nain and many of his disciples went with him and much peopleNow when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with herAnd when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her Weep notAnd he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still And he said Young man I say unto thee AriseAnd he that was dead sat up and began to speak And he delivered him to his motherAnd there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying That a great prophet is risen up among us and That God hath visited his peopleAnd this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea and throughout all the region round aboutAnd the disciples of John shewed him of all these thingsAnd John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying Art thou he that should come or look we for anotherWhen the men were come unto him they said John Baptist hath sent us unto thee saying Art thou he that should come or look we for anotherAnd in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sightThen Jesus answering said unto them Go your way and tell John what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preachedAnd blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in meAnd when the messengers of John were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning John What went ye out into the wilderness for to see A reed shaken with the windBut what went ye out for to see A man clothed in soft raiment Behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courtsBut what went ye out for to see A prophet Yea I say unto you and much more than a prophetThis is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before theeFor I say unto you Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than heAnd all the people that heard him and the publicans justified God being baptized with the baptism of JohnBut the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves being not baptized of himAnd the Lord said Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation and to what are they likeThey are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not weptFor John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say He hath a devilThe Son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinnersBut wisdom is justified of all her childrenAnd one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him And he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meatAnd behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointmentAnd stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointmentNow when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying This man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinnerAnd Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee And he saith Master say onThere was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fiftyAnd when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both Tell me therefore which of them will love him mostSimon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most And he said unto him Thou hast rightly judgedAnd he turned to the woman and said unto Simon Seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her headThou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feetMy head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointmentWherefore I say unto thee Her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth littleAnd he said unto her Thy sins are forgivenAnd they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves Who is this that forgiveth sins alsoAnd he said to the woman Thy faith hath saved thee go in peaceAnd it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God and the twelve were with himAnd certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene out of whom went seven devilsAnd Joanna the wife of Chuza Herods steward and Susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substanceAnd when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parableA sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured itAnd some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moistureAnd some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked itAnd other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold And when he had said these things he cried He that hath ears to hear let him hearAnd his disciples asked him saying What might this parable beAnd he said Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understandNow the parable is this The seed is the word of GodThose by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be savedThey on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall awayAnd that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfectionBut that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patienceNo man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the lightFor nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroadTake heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to haveThen came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the pressAnd it was told him by certain which said Thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see theeAnd he answered and said unto them My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God and do itNow it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them Let us go over unto the other side of the lake And they launched forthBut as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardyAnd they came to him and awoke him saying Master master we perish Then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calmAnd he said unto them Where is your faith And they being afraid wondered saying one to another What manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey himAnd they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes which is over against GalileeAnd when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombsWhen he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said What have I to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God most high I beseech thee torment me notFor he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man For oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wildernessAnd Jesus asked him saying What is thy name And he said Legion because many devils were entered into himAnd they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deepAnd there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them And he suffered themThen went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were chokedWhen they that fed them saw what was done they fled and went and told it in the city and in the countryThen they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraidThey also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healedThen the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back againNow the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away sayingReturn to thine own house and shew how great things God hath done unto thee And he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto himAnd it came to pass that when Jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for himAnd behold there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his houseFor he had one only daughter about twelve years of age and she lay a dying But as he went the people thronged himAnd a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of anyCame behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanchedAnd Jesus said Who touched me When all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou Who touched meAnd Jesus said Somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of meAnd when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediatelyAnd he said unto her Daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peaceWhile he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house saying to him Thy daughter is dead trouble not the MasterBut when Jesus heard it he answered him saying Fear not believe only and she shall be made wholeAnd when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maidenAnd all wept and bewailed her but he said Weep not she is not dead but sleepethAnd they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was deadAnd he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying Maid ariseAnd her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meatAnd her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was doneThen he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseasesAnd he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sickAnd he said unto them Take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apieceAnd whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence departAnd whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against themAnd they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every whereNow Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that John was risen from the deadAnd of some that Elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen againAnd Herod said John have I beheaded but who is this of whom I hear such things And he desired to see himAnd the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done And he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called BethsaidaAnd the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of God and healed them that had need of healingAnd when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him Send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert placeBut he said unto them Give ye them to eat And they said We have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this peopleFor they were about five thousand men And he said to his disciples Make them sit down by fifties in a companyAnd they did so and made them all sit downThen he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitudeAnd they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve basketsAnd it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying Whom say the people that I amThey answering said John the Baptist but some say Elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen againHe said unto them But whom say ye that I am Peter answering said The Christ of GodAnd he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thingSaying The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third dayAnd he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow meFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save itFor what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast awayFor whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his Fathers and of the holy angelsBut I tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of GodAnd it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to prayAnd as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glisteringAnd behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and EliasWho appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at JerusalemBut Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with himAnd it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias not knowing what he saidWhile he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloudAnd there came a voice out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son hear himAnd when the voice was past Jesus was found alone And they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seenAnd it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met himAnd behold a man of the company cried out saying Master I beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only childAnd lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from himAnd I besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could notAnd Jesus answering said O faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you and suffer you Bring thy son hitherAnd as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his fatherAnd they were all amazed at the mighty power of God But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did he said unto his disciplesLet these sayings sink down into your ears for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of menBut they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that sayingThen there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatestAnd Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by himAnd said unto them Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be greatAnd John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with usAnd Jesus said unto him Forbid him not for he that is not against us is for usAnd it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to JerusalemAnd sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for himAnd they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to JerusalemAnd when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias didBut he turned and rebuked them and said Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are ofFor the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them And they went to another villageAnd it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee whithersoever thou goestAnd Jesus said unto him Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his headAnd he said unto another Follow me But he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my fatherJesus said unto him Let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of GodAnd another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my houseAnd Jesus said unto him No man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of GodAfter these things the Lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would comeTherefore said he unto them The harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvestGo your ways behold I send you forth as lambs among wolvesCarry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the wayAnd into whatsoever house ye enter first say Peace be to this houseAnd if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you againAnd in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire Go not from house to houseAnd into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before youAnd heal the sick that are therein and say unto them The kingdom of God is come nigh unto youBut into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and sayEven the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto youBut I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that cityWoe unto thee Chorazin woe unto thee Bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashesBut it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for youAnd thou Capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hellHe that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent meAnd the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy nameAnd he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heavenBehold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt youNotwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heavenIn that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so Father for so it seemed good in thy sightAll things are delivered to me of my Father and no man knoweth who the Son is but the Father and who the Father is but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal himAnd he turned him unto his disciples and said privately Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye seeFor I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard themAnd behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal lifeHe said unto him What is written in the law how readest thouAnd he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyselfAnd he said unto him Thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt liveBut he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus And who is my neighbourAnd Jesus answering said A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half deadAnd by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other sideAnd likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other sideBut a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on himAnd went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of himAnd on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him Take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay theeWhich now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thievesAnd he said He that shewed mercy on him Then said Jesus unto him Go and do thou likewiseNow it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her houseAnd she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard his wordBut Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said Lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help meAnd Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha thou art careful and troubled about many thingsBut one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from herAnd it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciplesAnd he said unto them When ye pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done as in heaven so in earthGive us day by day our daily breadAnd forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evilAnd he said unto them Which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him Friend lend me three loavesFor a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and I have nothing to set before himAnd he from within shall answer and say Trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give theeI say unto you Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needethAnd I say unto you Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto youFor every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be openedIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpentOr if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpionIf ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask himAnd he was casting out a devil and it was dumb And it came to pass when the devil was gone out the dumb spake and the people wonderedBut some of them said He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devilsAnd others tempting him sought of him a sign from heavenBut he knowing their thoughts said unto them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house fallethIf Satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that I cast out devils through BeelzebubAnd if I by Beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judgesBut if I with the finger of God cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon youWhen a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peaceBut when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoilsHe that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scatterethWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith I will return unto my house whence I came outAnd when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnishedThen goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the firstAnd it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him Blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast suckedBut he said Yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep itAnd when the people were gathered thick together he began to say This is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonas the prophetFor as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites so shall also the Son of man be to this generationThe queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is hereThe men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is hereNo man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the lightThe light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darknessTake heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darknessIf thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee lightAnd as he spake a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meatAnd when the Pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinnerAnd the Lord said unto him Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickednessYe fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within alsoBut rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto youBut woe unto you Pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of God these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undoneWoe unto you Pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketsWoe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of themThen answered one of the lawyers and said unto him Master thus saying thou reproachest us alsoAnd he said Woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingersWoe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed themTruly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchresTherefore also said the wisdom of God I will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecuteThat the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generationFrom the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple verily I say unto you It shall be required of this generationWoe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hinderedAnd as he said these things unto them the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many thingsLaying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse himIn the mean time when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisyFor there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be knownTherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetopsAnd I say unto you my friends Be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can doBut I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear Fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea I say unto you Fear himAre not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before GodBut even the very hairs of your head are all numbered Fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrowsAlso I say unto you Whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of GodBut he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of GodAnd whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgivenAnd when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall sayFor the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to sayAnd one of the company said unto him Master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with meAnd he said unto him Man who made me a judge or a divider over youAnd he said unto them Take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possessethAnd he spake a parable unto them saying The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifullyAnd he thought within himself saying What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruitsAnd he said This will I do I will pull down my barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goodsAnd I will say to my soul Soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merryBut God said unto him Thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast providedSo is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward GodAnd he said unto his disciples Therefore I say unto you Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put onThe life is more than meat and the body is more than raimentConsider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and God feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowlsAnd which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubitIf ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the restConsider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theseIf then God so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you O ye of little faithAnd seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mindFor all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these thingsBut rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto youFear not little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdomSell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corruptethFor where your treasure is there will your heart be alsoLet your loins be girded about and your lights burningAnd ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediatelyBlessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily I say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve themAnd if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servantsAnd this know that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken throughBe ye therefore ready also for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think notThen Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to allAnd the Lord said Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due seasonBlessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doingOf a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hathBut and if that servant say in his heart My lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunkenThe lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelieversAnd that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripesBut he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes For unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the moreI am come to send fire on the earth and what will I if it be already kindledBut I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straitened till it be accomplishedSuppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth I tell you Nay but rather divisionFor from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against threeThe father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in lawAnd he said also to the people When ye see a cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say There cometh a shower and so it isAnd when ye see the south wind blow ye say There will be heat and it cometh to passYe hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this timeYea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is rightWhen thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prisonI tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last miteThere were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrificesAnd Jesus answering said unto them Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans because they suffered such thingsI tell you Nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perishOr those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in JerusalemI tell you Nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perishHe spake also this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found noneThen said he unto the dresser of his vineyard Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the groundAnd he answering said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung itAnd if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it downAnd he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbathAnd behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herselfAnd when Jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her Woman thou art loosed from thine infirmityAnd he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified GodAnd the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people There are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath dayThe Lord then answered him and said Thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to wateringAnd ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath dayAnd when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by himThen said he Unto what is the kingdom of God like and whereunto shall I resemble itIt is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of itAnd again he said Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of GodIt is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavenedAnd he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward JerusalemThen said one unto him Lord are there few that be saved And he said unto themStrive to enter in at the strait gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be ableWhen once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you I know you not whence ye areThen shall ye begin to say We have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streetsBut he shall say I tell you I know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquityThere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust outAnd they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of GodAnd behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be lastThe same day there came certain of the Pharisees saying unto him Get thee out and depart hence for Herod will kill theeAnd he said unto them Go ye and tell that fox Behold I cast out devils and I do cures to day and to morrow and the third day I shall be perfectedNevertheless I must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of JerusalemO Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would notBehold your house is left unto you desolate and verily I say unto you Ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LordAnd it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched himAnd behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsyAnd Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees saying Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath dayAnd they held their peace And he took him and healed him and let him goAnd answered them saying Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath dayAnd they could not answer him again to these thingsAnd he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto themWhen thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of himAnd he that bade thee and him come and say to thee Give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest roomBut when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee Friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with theeFor whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exaltedThen said he also to him that bade him When thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again and a recompence be made theeBut when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blindAnd thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the justAnd when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of GodThen said he unto him A certain man made a great supper and bade manyAnd sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden Come for all things are now readyAnd they all with one consent began to make excuse The first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excusedAnd another said I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excusedAnd another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot comeSo that servant came and shewed his lord these things Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blindAnd the servant said Lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is roomAnd the lord said unto the servant Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filledFor I say unto you That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supperAnd there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto themIf any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my discipleAnd whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my discipleFor which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish itLest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock himSaying This man began to build and was not able to finishOr what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousandOr else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peaceSo likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my discipleSalt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasonedIt is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out He that hath ears to hear let him hearThen drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear himAnd the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying This man receiveth sinners and eateth with themAnd he spake this parable unto them sayingWhat man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find itAnd when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicingAnd when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lostI say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentanceEither what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find itAnd when she hath found it she calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the piece which I had lostLikewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repentethAnd he said A certain man had two sonsAnd the younger of them said to his father Father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me And he divided unto them his livingAnd not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous livingAnd when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in wantAnd he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swineAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto himAnd when he came to himself he said How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hungerI will arise and go to my father and will say unto him Father I have sinned against heaven and before theeAnd am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servantsAnd he arose and came to his father But when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed himAnd the son said unto him Father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy sonBut the father said to his servants Bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feetAnd bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merryFor this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found And they began to be merryNow his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancingAnd he called one of the servants and asked what these things meantAnd he said unto him Thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and soundAnd he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated himAnd he answering said to his father Lo these many years do I serve thee neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make merry with my friendsBut as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calfAnd he said unto him Son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thineIt was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is foundAnd he said also unto his disciples There was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goodsAnd he called him and said unto him How is it that I hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer stewardThen the steward said within himself What shall I do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship I cannot dig to beg I am ashamedI am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their housesSo he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said unto the first How much owest thou unto my lordAnd he said An hundred measures of oil And he said unto him Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fiftyThen said he to another And how much owest thou And he said An hundred measures of wheat And he said unto him Take thy bill and write fourscoreAnd the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of lightAnd I say unto you Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitationsHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in muchIf therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true richesAnd if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall give you that which is your ownNo servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other Ye cannot serve God and mammonAnd the Pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided himAnd he said unto them Ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of GodThe law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into itAnd it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to failWhosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adulteryThere was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every dayAnd there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of soresAnd desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his soresAnd it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buriedAnd in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosomAnd he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flameBut Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormentedAnd beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thenceThen he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers houseFor I have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of tormentAbraham saith unto him They have Moses and the prophets let them hear themAnd he said Nay father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repentAnd he said unto him If they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the deadThen said he unto the disciples It is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they comeIt were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little onesTake heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive himAnd if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying I repent thou shalt forgive himAnd the apostles said unto the Lord Increase our faithAnd the Lord said If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree Be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey youBut which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field Go and sit down to meatAnd will not rather say unto him Make ready wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drinkDoth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him I trow notSo likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say We are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to doAnd it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and GalileeAnd as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar offAnd they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on usAnd when he saw them he said unto them Go shew yourselves unto the priests And it came to pass that as they went they were cleansedAnd one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified GodAnd fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a SamaritanAnd Jesus answering said Were there not ten cleansed but where are the nineThere are not found that returned to give glory to God save this strangerAnd he said unto him Arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee wholeAnd when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said The kingdom of God cometh not with observationNeither shall they say Lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within youAnd he said unto the disciples The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man and ye shall not see itAnd they shall say to you See here or see there go not after them nor follow themFor as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the Son of man be in his dayBut first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generationAnd as it was in the days of Noe so shall it be also in the days of the Son of manThey did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them allLikewise also as it was in the days of Lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they buildedBut the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them allEven thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealedIn that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return backRemember Lots wifeWhosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve itI tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be leftTwo women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other leftTwo men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other leftAnd they answered and said unto him Where Lord And he said unto them Wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered togetherAnd he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faintSaying There was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded manAnd there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying Avenge me of mine adversaryAnd he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself Though I fear not God nor regard manYet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary meAnd the Lord said Hear what the unjust judge saithAnd shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with themI tell you that he will avenge them speedily Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earthAnd he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised othersTwo men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a publicanThe Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publicanI fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possessAnd the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinnerI tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exaltedAnd they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked themBut Jesus called them unto him and said Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of GodVerily I say unto you Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter thereinAnd a certain ruler asked him saying Good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal lifeAnd Jesus said unto him Why callest thou me good none is good save one that is GodThou knowest the commandments Do not commit adultery Do not kill Do not steal Do not bear false witness Honour thy father and thy motherAnd he said All these have I kept from my youth upNow when Jesus heard these things he said unto him Yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow meAnd when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very richAnd when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of GodFor it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of GodAnd they that heard it said Who then can be savedAnd he said The things which are impossible with men are possible with GodThen Peter said Lo we have left all and followed theeAnd he said unto them Verily I say unto you There is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of Gods sakeWho shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlastingThen he took unto him the twelve and said unto them Behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplishedFor he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted onAnd they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise againAnd they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spokenAnd it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto Jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side beggingAnd hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meantAnd they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth byAnd he cried saying Jesus thou Son of David have mercy on meAnd they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more Thou Son of David have mercy on meAnd Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked himSaying What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee And he said Lord that I may receive my sightAnd Jesus said unto him Receive thy sight thy faith hath saved theeAnd immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto GodAnd Jesus entered and passed through JerichoAnd behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was richAnd he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of statureAnd he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that wayAnd when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day I must abide at thy houseAnd he made haste and came down and received him joyfullyAnd when they saw it they all murmured saying That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinnerAnd Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord Behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfoldAnd Jesus said unto him This day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of AbrahamFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lostAnd as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appearHe said therefore A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to returnAnd he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them Occupy till I comeBut his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying We will not have this man to reign over usAnd it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by tradingThen came the first saying Lord thy pound hath gained ten poundsAnd he said unto him Well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten citiesAnd the second came saying Lord thy pound hath gained five poundsAnd he said likewise to him Be thou also over five citiesAnd another came saying Lord behold here is thy pound which I have kept laid up in a napkinFor I feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sowAnd he saith unto him Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee thou wicked servant Thou knewest that I was an austere man taking up that I laid not down and reaping that I did not sowWherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required mine own with usuryAnd he said unto them that stood by Take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten poundsAnd they said unto him Lord he hath ten poundsFor I say unto you That unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from himBut those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them bring hither and slay them before meAnd when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to JerusalemAnd it came to pass when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called the mount of Olives he sent two of his disciplesSaying Go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hitherAnd if any man ask you Why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him Because the Lord hath need of himAnd they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto themAnd as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them Why loose ye the coltAnd they said The Lord hath need of himAnd they brought him to Jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set Jesus thereonAnd as he went they spread their clothes in the wayAnd when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seenSaying Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highestAnd some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciplesAnd he answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry outAnd when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over itSaying If thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyesFor the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every sideAnd shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitationAnd he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that boughtSaying unto them It is written My house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thievesAnd he taught daily in the temple But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy himAnd could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear himAnd it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the eldersAnd spake unto him saying Tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authorityAnd he answered and said unto them I will also ask you one thing and answer meThe baptism of John was it from heaven or of menAnd they reasoned with themselves saying If we shall say From heaven he will say Why then believed ye him notBut and if we say Of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that John was a prophetAnd they answered that they could not tell whence it wasAnd Jesus said unto them Neither tell I you by what authority I do these thingsThen began he to speak to the people this parable A certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long timeAnd at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away emptyAnd again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away emptyAnd again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him outThen said the lord of the vineyard What shall I do I will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see himBut when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying This is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be oursSo they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto themHe shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others And when they heard it they said God forbidAnd he beheld them and said What is this then that is written The stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the cornerWhosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powderAnd the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against themAnd they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governorAnd they asked him saying Master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of God trulyIs it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or noBut he perceived their craftiness and said unto them Why tempt ye meShew me a penny Whose image and superscription hath it They answered and said CaesarsAnd he said unto them Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesars and unto God the things which be GodsAnd they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peaceThen came to him certain of the Sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked himSaying Master Moses wrote unto us If any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brotherThere were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without childrenAnd the second took her to wife and he died childlessAnd the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and diedLast of all the woman died alsoTherefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wifeAnd Jesus answering said unto them The children of this world marry and are given in marriageBut they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriageNeither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the children of the resurrectionNow that the dead are raised even Moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of JacobFor he is not a God of the dead but of the living for all live unto himThen certain of the scribes answering said Master thou hast well saidAnd after that they durst not ask him any question at allAnd he said unto them How say they that Christ is Davids sonAnd David himself saith in the book of Psalms The LORD said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right handTill I make thine enemies thy footstoolDavid therefore calleth him Lord how is he then his sonThen in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciplesBeware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feastsWhich devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnationAnd he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasuryAnd he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mitesAnd he said Of a truth I say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they allFor all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she hadAnd as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he saidAs for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown downAnd they asked him saying Master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to passAnd he said Take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after themBut when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and byThen said he unto them Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdomAnd great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heavenBut before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sakeAnd it shall turn to you for a testimonySettle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answerFor I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resistAnd ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to deathAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my names sakeBut there shall not an hair of your head perishIn your patience possess ye your soulsAnd when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nighThen let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereintoFor these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilledBut woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this peopleAnd they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilledAnd there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaringMens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shakenAnd then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great gloryAnd when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nighAnd he spake to them a parable Behold the fig tree and all the treesWhen they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at handSo likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at handVerily I say unto you This generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilledHeaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass awayAnd take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawaresFor as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earthWatch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of manAnd in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of OlivesAnd all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear himNow the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the PassoverAnd the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the peopleThen entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot being of the number of the twelveAnd he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto themAnd they were glad and covenanted to give him moneyAnd he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitudeThen came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killedAnd he sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare us the passover that we may eatAnd they said unto him Where wilt thou that we prepareAnd he said unto them Behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth inAnd ye shall say unto the goodman of the house The Master saith unto thee Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciplesAnd he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make readyAnd they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passoverAnd when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with himAnd he said unto them With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I sufferFor I say unto you I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of GodAnd he took the cup and gave thanks and said Take this and divide it among yourselvesFor I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall comeAnd he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying This is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of meLikewise also the cup after supper saying This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for youBut behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the tableAnd truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayedAnd they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thingAnd there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatestAnd he said unto them The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactorsBut ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serveFor whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but I am among you as he that servethYe are they which have continued with me in my temptationsAnd I appoint unto you a kingdom as my Father hath appointed unto meThat ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of IsraelAnd the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheatBut I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethrenAnd he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to deathAnd he said I tell thee Peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest meAnd he said unto them When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing And they said NothingThen said he unto them But now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy oneFor I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me And he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an endAnd they said Lord behold here are two swords And he said unto them It is enoughAnd he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of Olives and his disciples also followed himAnd when he was at the place he said unto them Pray that ye enter not into temptationAnd he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayedSaying Father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be doneAnd there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening himAnd being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the groundAnd when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrowAnd said unto them Why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptationAnd while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto Jesus to kiss himBut Jesus said unto him Judas betrayest thou the Son of man with a kissWhen they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him Lord shall we smite with the swordAnd one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right earAnd Jesus answered and said Suffer ye thus far And he touched his ear and healed himThen Jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him Be ye come out as against a thief with swords and stavesWhen I was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darknessThen took they him and led him and brought him into the high priests house And Peter followed afar offAnd when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together Peter sat down among themBut a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said This man was also with himAnd he denied him saying Woman I know him notAnd after a little while another saw him and said Thou art also of them And Peter said Man I am notAnd about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying Of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a GalilaeanAnd Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest And immediately while he yet spake the cock crewAnd the Lord turned and looked upon Peter And Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thriceAnd Peter went out and wept bitterlyAnd the men that held Jesus mocked him and smote himAnd when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying Prophesy who is it that smote theeAnd many other things blasphemously spake they against himAnd as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council sayingArt thou the Christ tell us And he said unto them If I tell you ye will not believeAnd if I also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me goHereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of GodThen said they all Art thou then the Son of God And he said unto them Ye say that I amAnd they said What need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouthAnd the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto PilateAnd they began to accuse him saying We found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar saying that he himself is Christ a KingAnd Pilate asked him saying Art thou the King of the Jews And he answered him and said Thou sayest itThen said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people I find no fault in this manAnd they were the more fierce saying He stirreth up the people teaching throughout all Jewry beginning from Galilee to this placeWhen Pilate heard of Galilee he asked whether the man were a GalilaeanAnd as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who himself also was at Jerusalem at that timeAnd when Herod saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by himThen he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothingAnd the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused himAnd Herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to PilateAnd the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselvesAnd Pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the peopleSaid unto them Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold I having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse himNo nor yet Herod for I sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto himI will therefore chastise him and release himFor of necessity he must release one unto them at the feastAnd they cried out all at once saying Away with this man and release unto us BarabbasWho for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prisonPilate therefore willing to release Jesus spake again to themBut they cried saying Crucify him crucify himAnd he said unto them the third time Why what evil hath he done I have found no cause of death in him I will therefore chastise him and let him goAnd they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailedAnd Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requiredAnd he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered Jesus to their willAnd as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after JesusAnd there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented himBut Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your childrenFor behold the days are coming in the which they shall say Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suckThen shall they begin to say to the mountains Fall on us and to the hills Cover usFor if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dryAnd there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to deathAnd when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the leftThen said Jesus Father forgive them for they know not what they do And they parted his raiment and cast lotsAnd the people stood beholding And the rulers also with them derided him saying He saved others let him save himself if he be Christ the chosen of GodAnd the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegarAnd saying If thou be the king of the Jews save thyselfAnd a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWSAnd one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying If thou be Christ save thyself and usBut the other answering rebuked him saying Dost not thou fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnationAnd we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amissAnd he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdomAnd Jesus said unto him Verily I say unto thee To day shalt thou be with me in paradiseAnd it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hourAnd the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midstAnd when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said Father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghostNow when the centurion saw what was done he glorified God saying Certainly this was a righteous manAnd all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returnedAnd all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from Galilee stood afar off beholding these thingsAnd behold there was a man named Joseph a counseller and he was a good man and a justThe same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of Arimathaea a city of the Jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of GodThis man went unto Pilate and begged the body of JesusAnd he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laidAnd that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew onAnd the women also which came with him from Galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laidAnd they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandmentNow upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with themAnd they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchreAnd they entered in and found not the body of the Lord JesusAnd it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garmentsAnd as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them Why seek ye the living among the deadHe is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in GalileeSaying The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise againAnd they remembered his wordsAnd returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the restIt was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostlesAnd their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them notThen arose Peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to passAnd behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongsAnd they talked together of all these things which had happenedAnd it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with themBut their eyes were holden that they should not know himAnd he said unto them What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sadAnd the one of them whose name was Cleopas answering said unto him Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these daysAnd he said unto them What things And they said unto him Concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the peopleAnd how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified himBut we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were doneYea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchreAnd when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was aliveAnd certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw notThen he said unto them O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spokenOught not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his gloryAnd beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himselfAnd they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone furtherBut they constrained him saying Abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent And he went in to tarry with themAnd it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to themAnd their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sightAnd they said one to another Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripturesAnd they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with themSaying The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to SimonAnd they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of breadAnd as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them Peace be unto youBut they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spiritAnd he said unto them Why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heartsBehold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me haveAnd when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feetAnd while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them Have ye here any meatAnd they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycombAnd he took it and did eat before themAnd he said unto them These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning meThen opened he their understanding that they might understand the scripturesAnd said unto them Thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third dayAnd that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at JerusalemAnd ye are witnesses of these thingsAnd behold I send the promise of my Father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on highAnd he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed themAnd it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heavenAnd they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joyAnd were continually in the temple praising and blessing God AmenIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was GodThe same was in the beginning with GodAll things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was madeIn him was life and the life was the light of menAnd the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it notThere was a man sent from God whose name was JohnThe same came for a witness to bear witness of the Light that all men through him might believeHe was not that Light but was sent to bear witness of that LightThat was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the worldHe was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him notHe came unto his own and his own received him notBut as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his nameWhich were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of GodAnd the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truthJohn bare witness of him and cried saying This was he of whom I spake He that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before meAnd of his fulness have all we received and grace for graceFor the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus ChristNo man hath seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared himAnd this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who art thouAnd he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the ChristAnd they asked him What then Art thou Elias And he saith I am not Art thou that prophet And he answered NoThen said they unto him Who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us What sayest thou of thyselfHe said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet EsaiasAnd they which were sent were of the PhariseesAnd they asked him and said unto him Why baptizest thou then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias neither that prophetJohn answered them saying I baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know notHe it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unlooseThese things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was baptizingThe next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the worldThis is he of whom I said After me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before meAnd I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with waterAnd John bare record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon himAnd I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy GhostAnd I saw and bare record that this is the Son of GodAgain the next day after John stood and two of his disciplesAnd looking upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of GodAnd the two disciples heard him speak and they followed JesusThen Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them What seek ye They said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwellest thouHe saith unto them Come and see They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hourOne of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peters brotherHe first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him We have found the Messias which is being interpreted the ChristAnd he brought him to Jesus And when Jesus beheld him he said Thou art Simon the son of Jona thou shalt be called Cephas which is by interpretation A stoneThe day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philip and saith unto him Follow meNow Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and PeterPhilip findeth Nathanael and saith unto him We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of JosephAnd Nathanael said unto him Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto him Come and seeJesus saw Nathanael coming to him and saith of him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guileNathanael saith unto him Whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him Before that Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree I saw theeNathanael answered and saith unto him Rabbi thou art the Son of God thou art the King of IsraelJesus answered and said unto him Because I said unto thee I saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than theseAnd he saith unto him Verily verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of manAnd the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was thereAnd both Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriageAnd when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus saith unto him They have no wineJesus saith unto her Woman what have I to do with thee mine hour is not yet comeHis mother saith unto the servants Whatsoever he saith unto you do itAnd there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three firkins apieceJesus saith unto them Fill the waterpots with water And they filled them up to the brimAnd he saith unto them Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast And they bare itWhen the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroomAnd saith unto him Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until nowThis beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on himAfter this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many daysAnd the Jews passover was at hand and Jesus went up to JerusalemAnd found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sittingAnd when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tablesAnd said unto them that sold doves Take these things hence make not my Fathers house an house of merchandiseAnd his disciples remembered that it was written The zeal of thine house hath eaten me upThen answered the Jews and said unto him What sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these thingsJesus answered and said unto them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it upThen said the Jews Forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three daysBut he spake of the temple of his bodyWhen therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had saidNow when he was in Jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he didBut Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all menAnd needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in manThere was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the JewsThe same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with himJesus answered and said unto him Verily verily I say unto thee Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of GodNicodemus saith unto him How can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be bornJesus answered Verily verily I say unto thee Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of GodThat which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spiritMarvel not that I said unto thee Ye must be born againThe wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the SpiritNicodemus answered and said unto him How can these things beJesus answered and said unto him Art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these thingsVerily verily I say unto thee We speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witnessIf I have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly thingsAnd no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the Son of man which is in heavenAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted upThat whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal lifeFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting lifeFor God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be savedHe that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of GodAnd this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evilFor every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reprovedBut he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in GodAfter these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea and there he tarried with them and baptizedAnd John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptizedFor John was not yet cast into prisonThen there arose a question between some of Johns disciples and the Jews about purifyingAnd they came unto John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with thee beyond Jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to himJohn answered and said A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heavenYe yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before himHe that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilledHe must increase but I must decreaseHe that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above allAnd what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimonyHe that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is trueFor he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto himThe Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his handHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on himWhen therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than JohnThough Jesus himself baptized not but his disciplesHe left Judaea and departed again into GalileeAnd he must needs go through SamariaThen cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son JosephNow Jacobs well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hourThere cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her Give me to drinkFor his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meatThen saith the woman of Samaria unto him How is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the SamaritansJesus answered and said unto her If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee Give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living waterThe woman saith unto him Sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living waterArt thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattleJesus answered and said unto her Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst againBut whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting lifeThe woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to drawJesus saith unto her Go call thy husband and come hitherThe woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her Thou hast well said I have no husbandFor thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou trulyThe woman saith unto him Sir I perceive that thou art a prophetOur fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worshipJesus saith unto her Woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the FatherYe worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the JewsBut the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father seeketh such to worship himGod is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truthThe woman saith unto him I know that Messias cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all thingsJesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am heAnd upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said What seekest thou or Why talkest thou with herThe woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the menCome see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the ChristThen they went out of the city and came unto himIn the mean while his disciples prayed him saying Master eatBut he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not ofTherefore said the disciples one to another Hath any man brought him ought to eatJesus saith unto them My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his workSay not ye There are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold I say unto you Lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvestAnd he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice togetherAnd herein is that saying true One soweth and another reapethI sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their laboursAnd many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified He told me all that ever I didSo when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two daysAnd many more believed because of his own wordAnd said unto the woman Now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the Saviour of the worldNow after two days he departed thence and went into GalileeFor Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own countryThen when he was come into Galilee the Galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feastSo Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at CapernaumWhen he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of deathThen said Jesus unto him Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believeThe nobleman saith unto him Sir come down ere my child dieJesus saith unto him Go thy way thy son liveth And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his wayAnd as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying Thy son livethThen inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend And they said unto him Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left himSo the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which Jesus said unto him Thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole houseThis is again the second miracle that Jesus did when he was come out of Judaea into GalileeAfter this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to JerusalemNow there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porchesIn these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the waterFor an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he hadAnd a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight yearsWhen Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him Wilt thou be made wholeThe impotent man answered him Sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steppeth down before meJesus saith unto him Rise take up thy bed and walkAnd immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbathThe Jews therefore said unto him that was cured It is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bedHe answered them He that made me whole the same said unto me Take up thy bed and walkThen asked they him What man is that which said unto thee Take up thy bed and walkAnd he that was healed wist not who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that placeAfterward Jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him Behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto theeThe man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him wholeAnd therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath dayBut Jesus answered them My Father worketh hitherto and I workTherefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that God was his Father making himself equal with GodThen answered Jesus and said unto them Verily verily I say unto you The Son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the Son likewiseFor the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvelFor as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he willFor the Father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the SonThat all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent himVerily verily I say unto you He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto lifeVerily verily I say unto you The hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall liveFor as the Father hath life in himself so hath he given to the Son to have life in himselfAnd hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the Son of manMarvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voiceAnd shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnationI can of mine own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which hath sent meIf I bear witness of myself my witness is not trueThere is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is trueYe sent unto John and he bare witness unto the truthBut I receive not testimony from man but these things I say that ye might be savedHe was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his lightBut I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the Father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the Father hath sent meAnd the Father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shapeAnd ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe notSearch the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of meAnd ye will not come to me that ye might have lifeI receive not honour from menBut I know you that ye have not the love of God in youI am come in my Fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receiveHow can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from God onlyDo not think that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuseth you even Moses in whom ye trustFor had ye believed Moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of meBut if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my wordsAfter these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee which is the sea of TiberiasAnd a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseasedAnd Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciplesAnd the passover a feast of the Jews was nighWhen Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto Philip Whence shall we buy bread that these may eatAnd this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would doPhilip answered him Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a littleOne of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother saith unto himThere is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so manyAnd Jesus said Make the men sit down Now there was much grass in the place So the men sat down in number about five thousandAnd Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they wouldWhen they were filled he said unto his disciples Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lostTherefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eatenThen those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the worldWhen Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself aloneAnd when even was now come his disciples went down unto the seaAnd entered into a ship and went over the sea toward Capernaum And it was now dark and Jesus was not come to themAnd the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blewSo when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraidBut he saith unto them It is I be not afraidThen they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they wentThe day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away aloneHowbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the Lord had given thanksWhen the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for JesusAnd when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hitherJesus answered them and said Verily verily I say unto you Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filledLabour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealedThen said they unto him What shall we do that we might work the works of GodJesus answered and said unto them This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sentThey said therefore unto him What sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou workOur fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eatThen Jesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my Father giveth you the true bread from heavenFor the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the worldThen said they unto him Lord evermore give us this breadAnd Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirstBut I said unto you That ye also have seen me and believe notAll that the Father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast outFor I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent meAnd this is the Fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last dayAnd this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last dayThe Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heavenAnd they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from heavenJesus therefore answered and said unto them Murmur not among yourselvesNo man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last dayIt is written in the prophets And they shall be all taught of God Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto meNot that any man hath seen the Father save he which is of God he hath seen the FatherVerily verily I say unto you He that believeth on me hath everlasting lifeI am that bread of lifeYour fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are deadThis is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not dieI am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the worldThe Jews therefore strove among themselves saying How can this man give us his flesh to eatThen Jesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in youWhoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last dayFor my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeedHe that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in himAs the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father so he that eateth me even he shall live by meThis is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for everThese things said he in the synagogue as he taught in CapernaumMany therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said This is an hard saying who can hear itWhen Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them Doth this offend youWhat and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was beforeIt is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are lifeBut there are some of you that believe not For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray himAnd he said Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my FatherFrom that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with himThen said Jesus unto the twelve Will ye also go awayThen Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal lifeAnd we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living GodJesus answered them Have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is a devilHe spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelveAfter these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in Jewry because the Jews sought to kill himNow the Jews feast of tabernacles was at handHis brethren therefore said unto him Depart hence and go into Judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doestFor there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly If thou do these things shew thyself to the worldFor neither did his brethren believe in himThen Jesus said unto them My time is not yet come but your time is alway readyThe world cannot hate you but me it hateth because I testify of it that the works thereof are evilGo ye up unto this feast I go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full comeWhen he had said these words unto them he abode still in GalileeBut when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secretThen the Jews sought him at the feast and said Where is heAnd there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said He is a good man others said Nay but he deceiveth the peopleHowbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the JewsNow about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taughtAnd the Jews marvelled saying How knoweth this man letters having never learnedJesus answered them and said My doctrine is not mine but his that sent meIf any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myselfHe that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in himDid not Moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law Why go ye about to kill meThe people answered and said Thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill theeJesus answered and said unto them I have done one work and ye all marvelMoses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of Moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a manIf a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath dayJudge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgmentThen said some of them of Jerusalem Is not this he whom they seek to killBut lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very ChristHowbeit we know this man whence he is but when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence he isThen cried Jesus in the temple as he taught saying Ye both know me and ye know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know notBut I know him for I am from him and he hath sent meThen they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet comeAnd many of the people believed on him and said When Christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath doneThe Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take himThen said Jesus unto them Yet a little while am I with you and then I go unto him that sent meYe shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither ye cannot comeThen said the Jews among themselves Whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the GentilesWhat manner of saying is this that he said Ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither ye cannot comeIn the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirst let him come unto me and drinkHe that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waterBut this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorifiedMany of the people therefore when they heard this saying said Of a truth this is the ProphetOthers said This is the Christ But some said Shall Christ come out of GalileeHath not the scripture said That Christ cometh of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David wasSo there was a division among the people because of himAnd some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on himThen came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees and they said unto them Why have ye not brought himThe officers answered Never man spake like this manThen answered them the Pharisees Are ye also deceivedHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on himBut this people who knoweth not the law are cursedNicodemus saith unto them he that came to Jesus by night being one of themDoth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doethThey answered and said unto him Art thou also of Galilee Search and look for out of Galilee ariseth no prophetAnd every man went unto his own houseJesus went unto the mount of OlivesAnd early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught themAnd the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midstThey say unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very actNow Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thouThis they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them notSo when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at herAnd again he stooped down and wrote on the groundAnd they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midstWhen Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her Woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned theeShe said No man Lord And Jesus said unto her Neither do I condemn thee go and sin no moreThen spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of lifeThe Pharisees therefore said unto him Thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not trueJesus answered and said unto them Though I bear record of myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and whither I go but ye cannot tell whence I come and whither I goYe judge after the flesh I judge no manAnd yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I and the Father that sent meIt is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is trueI am one that bear witness of myself and the Father that sent me beareth witness of meThen said they unto him Where is thy Father Jesus answered Ye neither know me nor my Father if ye had known me ye should have known my Father alsoThese words spake Jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet comeThen said Jesus again unto them I go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither I go ye cannot comeThen said the Jews Will he kill himself because he saith Whither I go ye cannot comeAnd he said unto them Ye are from beneath I am from above ye are of this world I am not of this worldI said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sinsThen said they unto him Who art thou And Jesus saith unto them Even the same that I said unto you from the beginningI have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of himThey understood not that he spake to them of the FatherThen said Jesus unto them When ye have lifted up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my Father hath taught me I speak these thingsAnd he that sent me is with me the Father hath not left me alone for I do always those things that please himAs he spake these words many believed on himThen said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him If ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeedAnd ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you freeThey answered him We be Abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou Ye shall be made freeJesus answered them Verily verily I say unto you Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sinAnd the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the Son abideth everIf the Son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeedI know that ye are Abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in youI speak that which I have seen with my Father and ye do that which ye have seen with your fatherThey answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto them If ye were Abrahams children ye would do the works of AbrahamBut now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not AbrahamYe do the deeds of your father Then said they to him We be not born of fornication we have one Father even GodJesus said unto them If God were your Father ye would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent meWhy do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my wordYe are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of itAnd because I tell you the truth ye believe me notWhich of you convinceth me of sin And if I say the truth why do ye not believe meHe that is of God heareth Gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of GodThen answered the Jews and said unto him Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a devilJesus answered I have not a devil but I honour my Father and ye do dishonour meAnd I seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgethVerily verily I say unto you If a man keep my saying he shall never see deathThen said the Jews unto him Now we know that thou hast a devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest If a man keep my saying he shall never taste of deathArt thou greater than our father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyselfJesus answered If I honour myself my honour is nothing it is my Father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your GodYet ye have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like unto you but I know him and keep his sayingYour father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was gladThen said the Jews unto him Thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen AbrahamJesus said unto them Verilyverily I say unto you Before Abraham was I amThen took they up stones to cast at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed byAnd as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birthAnd his disciples asked him saying Master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blindJesus answered Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in himI must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can workAs long as I am in the world I am the light of the worldWhen he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clayAnd said unto him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which is by interpretation Sent He went his way therefore and washed and came seeingThe neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said Is not this he that sat and beggedSome said This is he others said He is like him but he said I am heTherefore said they unto him How were thine eyes openedHe answered and said A man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me Go to the pool of Siloam and wash and I went and washed and I received sightThen said they unto him Where is he He said I know notThey brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blindAnd it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyesThen again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight He said unto them He put clay upon mine eyes and I washed and do seeTherefore said some of the Pharisees This man is not of God because he keepeth not the sabbath day Others said How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles And there was a division among themThey say unto the blind man again What sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes He said He is a prophetBut the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sightAnd they asked them saying Is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now seeHis parents answered them and said We know that this is our son and that he was born blindBut by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himselfThese words spake his parents because they feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ he should be put out of the synagogueTherefore said his parents He is of age ask himThen again called they the man that was blind and said unto him Give God the praise we know that this man is a sinnerHe answered and said Whether he be a sinner or no I know not one thing I know that whereas I was blind now I seeThen said they to him again What did he to thee how opened he thine eyesHe answered them I have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciplesThen they reviled him and said Thou art his disciple but we are Moses disciplesWe know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he isThe man answered and said unto them Why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyesNow we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth his will him he hearethSince the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blindIf this man were not of God he could do nothingThey answered and said unto him Thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us And they cast him outJesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him Dost thou believe on the Son of GodHe answered and said Who is he Lord that I might believe on himAnd Jesus said unto him Thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with theeAnd he said Lord I believe And he worshipped himAnd Jesus said For judgment I am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blindAnd some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him Are we blind alsoJesus said unto them If ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say We see therefore your sin remainethVerily verily I say unto you He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robberBut he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheepTo him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them outAnd when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voiceAnd a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangersThis parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto themThen said Jesus unto them again Verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheepAll that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear themI am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pastureThe thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantlyI am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheepBut he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheepThe hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheepI am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mineAs the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father and I lay down my life for the sheepAnd other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherdTherefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it againNo man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again This commandment have I received of my FatherThere was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayingsAnd many of them said He hath a devil and is mad why hear ye himOthers said These are not the words of him that hath a devil Can a devil open the eyes of the blindAnd it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winterAnd Jesus walked in the temple in Solomons porchThen came the Jews round about him and said unto him How long dost thou make us to doubt If thou be the Christ tell us plainlyJesus answered them I told you and ye believed not the works that I do in my Fathers name they bear witness of meBut ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto youMy sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow meAnd I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my handMy Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers handI and my Father are oneThen the Jews took up stones again to stone himJesus answered them Many good works have I shewed you from my Father for which of those works do ye stone meThe Jews answered him saying For a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself GodJesus answered them Is it not written in your law I said Ye are godsIf he called them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be brokenSay ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world Thou blasphemest because I said I am the Son of GodIf I do not the works of my Father believe me notBut if I do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in himTherefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their handAnd went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized and there he abodeAnd many resorted unto him and said John did no miracle but all things that John spake of this man were trueAnd many believed on him thereNow a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister MarthaIt was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sickTherefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sickWhen Jesus heard that he said This sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified therebyNow Jesus loved Martha and her sister and LazarusWhen he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he wasThen after that saith he to his disciples Let us go into Judaea againHis disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither againJesus answered Are there not twelve hours in the day If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this worldBut if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in himThese things said he and after that he saith unto them Our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleepThen said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do wellHowbeit Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleepThen said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is deadAnd I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto himThen said Thomas which is called Didymus unto his fellowdisciples Let us also go that we may die with himThen when Jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days alreadyNow Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about fifteen furlongs offAnd many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brotherThen Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the houseThen said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not diedBut I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of God God will give it theeJesus saith unto her Thy brother shall rise againMartha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last dayJesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he liveAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die Believest thou thisShe saith unto him Yea Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which should come into the worldAnd when she had so said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying The Master is come and calleth for theeAs soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto himNow Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where Martha met himThe Jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying She goeth unto the grave to weep thereThen when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not diedWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubledAnd said Where have ye laid him They said unto him Lord come and seeJesus weptThen said the Jews Behold how he loved himAnd some of them said Could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have diedJesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave It was a cave and a stone lay upon itJesus said Take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four daysJesus saith unto her Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of GodThen they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said Father I thank thee that thou hast heard meAnd I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou hast sent meAnd when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forthAnd he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus saith unto them Loose him and let him goThen many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on himBut some of them went their ways to the Pharisees and told them what things Jesus had doneThen gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said What do we for this man doeth many miraclesIf we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nationAnd one of them named Caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them Ye know nothing at allNor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish notAnd this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nationAnd not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroadThen from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to deathJesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called Ephraim and there continued with his disciplesAnd the Jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover to purify themselvesThen sought they for Jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple What think ye that he will not come to the feastNow both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take himThen Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the deadThere they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with himThen took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointmentThen saith one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simons son which should betray himWhy was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poorThis he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put thereinThen said Jesus Let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept thisFor the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not alwaysMuch people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the deadBut the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to deathBecause that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on JesusOn the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to JerusalemTook branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried Hosanna Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the LordAnd Jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is writtenFear not daughter of Sion behold thy King cometh sitting on an asss coltThese things understood not his disciples at the first but when Jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto himThe people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare recordFor this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracleThe Pharisees therefore said among themselves Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after himAnd there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feastThe same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee and desired him saying Sir we would see JesusPhilip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell JesusAnd Jesus answered them saying The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorifiedVerily verily I say unto you Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruitHe that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternalIf any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my Father honourNow is my soul troubled and what shall I say Father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hourFather glorify thy name Then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it againThe people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said An angel spake to himJesus answered and said This voice came not because of me but for your sakesNow is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast outAnd I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto meThis he said signifying what death he should dieThe people answered him We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou The Son of man must be lifted up who is this Son of manThen Jesus said unto them Yet a little while is the light with you Walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goethWhile ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light These things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from themBut though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on himThat the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake Lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealedTherefore they could not believe because that Esaias said againHe hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal themThese things said Esaias when he saw his glory and spake of himNevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogueFor they loved the praise of men more than the praise of GodJesus cried and said He that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent meAnd he that seeth me seeth him that sent meI am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darknessAnd if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the worldHe that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last dayFor I have not spoken of myself but the Father which sent me he gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speakAnd I know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever I speak therefore even as the Father said unto me so I speakNow before the feast of the passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the endAnd supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simons son to betray himJesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to GodHe riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himselfAfter that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girdedThen cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord dost thou wash my feetJesus answered and said unto him What I do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafterPeter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him If I wash thee not thou hast no part with meSimon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my headJesus saith to him He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not allFor he knew who should betray him therefore said he Ye are not all cleanSo after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them Know ye what I have done to youYe call me Master and Lord and ye say well for so I amIf I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feetFor I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to youVerily verily I say unto you The servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent himIf ye know these things happy are ye if ye do themI speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against meNow I tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that I am heVerily verily I say unto you He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent meWhen Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said Verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray meThen the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spakeNow there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus lovedSimon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spakeHe then lying on Jesus breast saith unto him Lord who is itJesus answered He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it And when he had dipped the sop he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of SimonAnd after the sop Satan entered into him Then said Jesus unto him That thou doest do quicklyNow no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto himFor some of them thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him Buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poorHe then having received the sop went immediately out and it was nightTherefore when he was gone out Jesus said Now is the Son of man glorified and God is glorified in himIf God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify himLittle children yet a little while I am with you Ye shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews Whither I go ye cannot come so now I say to youA new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one anotherBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to anotherSimon Peter said unto him Lord whither goest thou Jesus answered him Whither I go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwardsPeter said unto him Lord why cannot I follow thee now I will lay down my life for thy sakeJesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake Verily verily I say unto thee The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thriceLet not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in meIn my Fathers house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for youAnd if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be alsoAnd whither I go ye know and the way ye knowThomas saith unto him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the wayJesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by meIf ye had known me ye should have known my Father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen himPhilip saith unto him Lord shew us the Father and it sufficeth usJesus saith unto him Have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me hath seen the Father and how sayest thou then Shew us the FatherBelievest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the Father that dwelleth in me he doeth the worksBelieve me that I am in the Father and the Father in me or else believe me for the very works sakeVerily verily I say unto you He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my FatherAnd whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the SonIf ye shall ask any thing in my name I will do itIf ye love me keep my commandmentsAnd I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for everEven the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in youI will not leave you comfortless I will come to youYet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live alsoAt that day ye shall know that I am in my Father and ye in me and I in youHe that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to himJudas saith unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the worldJesus answered and said unto him If a man love me he will keep my words and my Father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with himHe that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the Fathers which sent meThese things have I spoken unto you being yet present with youBut the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto youPeace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraidYe have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you If ye loved me ye would rejoice because I said I go unto the Father for my Father is greater than IAnd now I have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believeHereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in meBut that the world may know that I love the Father and as the Father gave me commandment even so I do Arise let us go henceI am the true vine and my Father is the husbandmanEvery branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruitNow ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto youAbide in me and I in you As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in meI am the vine ye are the branches He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothingIf a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burnedIf ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto youHerein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciplesAs the Father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my loveIf ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I have kept my Fathers commandments and abide in his loveThese things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be fullThis is my commandment That ye love one another as I have loved youGreater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friendsYe are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command youHenceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto youYe have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it youThese things I command you that ye love one anotherIf the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated youIf ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth youRemember the word that I said unto you The servant is not greater than his lord If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours alsoBut all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent meIf I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sinHe that hateth me hateth my Father alsoIf I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my FatherBut this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law They hated me without a causeBut when the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father he shall testify of meAnd ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginningThese things have I spoken unto you that ye should not be offendedThey shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God serviceAnd these things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father nor meBut these things have I told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them And these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with youBut now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me Whither goest thouBut because I have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heartNevertheless I tell you the truth It is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto youAnd when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgmentOf sin because they believe not on meOf righteousness because I go to my Father and ye see me no moreOf judgment because the prince of this world is judgedI have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them nowHowbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to comeHe shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto youAll things that the Father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto youA little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because I go to the FatherThen said some of his disciples among themselves What is this that he saith unto us A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and Because I go to the FatherThey said therefore What is this that he saith A little while we cannot tell what he saithNow Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see meVerily verily I say unto you That ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joyA woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the worldAnd ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from youAnd in that day ye shall ask me nothing Verily verily I say unto you Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give it youHitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be fullThese things have I spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but I shall shew you plainly of the FatherAt that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for youFor the Father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from GodI came forth from the Father and am come into the world again I leave the world and go to the FatherHis disciples said unto him Lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverbNow are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from GodJesus answered them Do ye now believeBehold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the Father is with meThese things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the worldThese words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said Father the hour is come glorify thy Son that thy Son also may glorify theeAs thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given himAnd this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sentI have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to doAnd now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world wasI have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy wordNow they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of theeFor I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send meI pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thineAnd all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in themAnd now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we areWhile I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilledAnd now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselvesI have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the worldI pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evilThey are not of the world even as I am not of the worldSanctify them through thy truth thy word is truthAs thou hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the worldAnd for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truthNeither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their wordThat they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent meAnd the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are oneI in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved meFather I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the worldO righteous Father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent meAnd I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in themWhen Jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciplesAnd Judas also which betrayed him knew the place for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciplesJudas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weaponsJesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them Whom seek yeThey answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus saith unto them I am he And Judas also which betrayed him stood with themAs soon then as he had said unto them I am he they went backward and fell to the groundThen asked he them again Whom seek ye And they said Jesus of NazarethJesus answered I have told you that I am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their wayThat the saying might be fulfilled which he spake Of them which thou gavest me have I lost noneThen Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear The servants name was MalchusThen said Jesus unto Peter Put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink itThen the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound himAnd led him away to Annas first for he was father in law to Caiaphas which was the high priest that same yearNow Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the peopleAnd Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priestBut Peter stood at the door without Then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in PeterThen saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter Art not thou also one of this mans disciples He saith I am notAnd the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and Peter stood with them and warmed himselfThe high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrineJesus answered him I spake openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the Jews always resort and in secret have I said nothingWhy askest thou me ask them which heard me what I have said unto them behold they know what I saidAnd when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand saying Answerest thou the high priest soJesus answered him If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou meNow Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priestAnd Simon Peter stood and warmed himself They said therefore unto him Art not thou also one of his disciples He denied it and said I am notOne of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off saith Did not I see thee in the garden with himPeter then denied again and immediately the cock crewThen led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passoverPilate then went out unto them and said What accusation bring ye against this manThey answered and said unto him If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto theeThen said Pilate unto them Take ye him and judge him according to your law The Jews therefore said unto him It is not lawful for us to put any man to deathThat the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should dieThen Pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called Jesus and said unto him Art thou the King of the JewsJesus answered him Sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of mePilate answered Am I a Jew Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou doneJesus answered My kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hencePilate therefore said unto him Art thou a king then Jesus answered Thou sayest that I am a king To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth Every one that is of the truth heareth my voicePilate saith unto him What is truth And when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find in him no fault at allBut ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the JewsThen cried they all again saying Not this man but Barabbas Now Barabbas was a robberThen Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged himAnd the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robeAnd said Hail King of the Jews and they smote him with their handsPilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them Behold I bring him forth to you that ye may know that I find no fault in himThen came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe And Pilate saith unto them Behold the manWhen the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying Crucify him crucify him Pilate saith unto them Take ye him and crucify him for I find no fault in himThe Jews answered him We have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of GodWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraidAnd went again into the judgment hall and saith unto Jesus Whence art thou But Jesus gave him no answerThen saith Pilate unto him Speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release theeJesus answered Thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sinAnd from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying If thou let this man go thou art not Caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against CaesarWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement but in the Hebrew GabbathaAnd it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the Jews Behold your KingBut they cried out Away with him away with him crucify him Pilate saith unto them Shall I crucify your King The chief priest answered We have no king but CaesarThen delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified And they took Jesus and led him awayAnd he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the Hebrew GolgothaWhere they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and Jesus in the midstAnd Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWSThis title then read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and LatinThen said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate Write not The King of the Jews but that he said I am King of the JewsPilate answered What I have written I have writtenThen the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughoutThey said therefore among themselves Let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith They parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots These things therefore the soldiers didNow there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wife of Cleophas and Mary MagdaleneWhen Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother Woman behold thy sonThen saith he to the disciple Behold thy mother And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own homeAfter this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirstNow there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouthWhen Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghostThe Jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken awayThen came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with himBut when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legsBut one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and waterAnd he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believeFor these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled A bone of him shall not be brokenAnd again another scripture saith They shall look on him whom they piercedAnd after this Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him leave He came therefore and took the body of JesusAnd there came also Nicodemus which at the first came to Jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weightThen took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the Jews is to buryNow in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laidThere laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at handThe first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchreThen she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto them They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid himPeter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchreSo they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the sepulchreAnd he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not inThen cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lieAnd the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itselfThen went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believedFor as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the deadThen the disciples went away again unto their own homeBut Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchreAnd seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lainAnd they say unto her Woman why weepest thou She saith unto them Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid himAnd when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was JesusJesus saith unto her Woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou She supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him Sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him awayJesus saith unto her Mary She turned herself and saith unto him Rabboni which is to say MasterJesus saith unto her Touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your GodMary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto herThen the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them Peace be unto youAnd when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side Then were the disciples glad when they saw the LordThen said Jesus to them again Peace be unto you as my Father hath sent me even so send I youAnd when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them Receive ye the Holy GhostWhose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retainedBut Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus was not with them when Jesus cameThe other disciples therefore said unto him We have seen the Lord But he said unto them Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believeAnd after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto youThen saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believingAnd Thomas answered and said unto him My Lord and my GodJesus saith unto him Thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believedAnd many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this bookBut these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing ye might have life through his nameAfter these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and on this wise shewed he himselfThere were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciplesSimon Peter saith unto them I go a fishing They say unto him We also go with thee They went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothingBut when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was JesusThen Jesus saith unto them Children have ye any meat They answered him NoAnd he said unto them Cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find They cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishesTherefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter It is the Lord Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the seaAnd the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishesAs soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and breadJesus saith unto them Bring of the fish which ye have now caughtSimon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net brokenJesus saith unto them Come and dine And none of the disciples durst ask him Who art thou knowing that it was the LordJesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewiseThis is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the deadSo when they had dined Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these He saith unto him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He saith unto him Feed my lambsHe saith to him again the second time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me He saith unto him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He saith unto him Feed my sheepHe saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time Lovest thou me And he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him Feed my sheepVerily verily I say unto thee When thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest notThis spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God And when he had spoken this he saith unto him Follow meThen Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth theePeter seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man doJesus saith unto him If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee follow thou meThen went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him He shall not die but If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to theeThis is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is trueAnd there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written every one I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written AmenThe former treatise have I made O Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teachUntil the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosenTo whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of GodAnd being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of meFor John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days henceWhen they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to IsraelAnd he said unto them It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own powerBut ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earthAnd when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sightAnd while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparelWhich also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heavenThen returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a sabbath days journeyAnd when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of Alphaeus and Simon Zelotes and Judas the brother of JamesThese all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethrenAnd in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twentyMen and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took JesusFor he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministryNow this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed outAnd it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue Aceldama that is to say The field of bloodFor it is written in the book of Psalms Let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another takeWherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among usBeginning from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrectionAnd they appointed two Joseph called Barsabas who was surnamed Justus and MatthiasAnd they prayed and said Thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosenThat he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own placeAnd they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostlesAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one placeAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sittingAnd there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of themAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utteranceAnd there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heavenNow when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own languageAnd they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another Behold are not all these which speak GalilaeansAnd how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were bornParthians and Medes and Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judaea and Cappadocia in Pontus and AsiaPhrygia and Pamphylia in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene and strangers of Rome Jews and proselytesCretes and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of GodAnd they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another What meaneth thisOthers mocking said These men are full of new wineBut Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them Ye men of Judaea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my wordsFor these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the dayBut this is that which was spoken by the prophet JoelAnd it shall come to pass in the last days saith GodI will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreamsAnd on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit and they shall prophesyAnd I will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smokeThe sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord comeAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be savedYe men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also knowHim being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slainWhom God hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of itFor David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be movedTherefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hopeBecause thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruptionThou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenanceMen and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this dayTherefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throneHe seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruptionThis Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnessesTherefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hearFor David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself The LORD said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right handUntil I make thy foes thy footstoolTherefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and ChristNow when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles Men and brethren what shall we doThen Peter said unto them Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy GhostFor the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall callAnd with many other words did he testify and exhort saying Save yourselves from this untoward generationThen they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand soulsAnd they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayersAnd fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostlesAnd all that believed were together and had all things commonAnd sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had needAnd they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heartPraising God and having favour with all the people And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be savedNow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hourAnd a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the templeWho seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an almsAnd Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said Look on usAnd he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of themThen Peter said Silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I thee In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walkAnd he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strengthAnd he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising GodAnd all the people saw him walking and praising GodAnd they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto himAnd as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomons greatly wonderingAnd when Peter saw it he answered unto the people Ye men of Israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walkThe God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him goBut ye denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer to be granted unto youAnd killed the Prince of life whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnessesAnd his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you allAnd now brethren I wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulersBut those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilledRepent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the LordAnd he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto youWhom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world beganFor Moses truly said unto the fathers A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto youAnd it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the peopleYea and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these daysYe are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessedUnto you first God having raised up his Son Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquitiesAnd as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon themBeing grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the deadAnd they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventideHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousandAnd it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribesAnd Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at JerusalemAnd when they had set them in the midst they asked By what power or by what name have ye done thisThen Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them Ye rulers of the people and elders of IsraelIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made wholeBe it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you wholeThis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the cornerNeither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be savedNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with JesusAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against itBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselvesSaying What shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny itBut that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this nameAnd they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of JesusBut Peter and John answered and said unto them Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge yeFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heardSo when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was doneFor the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewedAnd being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto themAnd when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said Lord thou art God which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them isWho by the mouth of thy servant David hast said Why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain thingsThe kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his ChristFor of a truth against thy holy child Jesus whom thou hast anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered togetherFor to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be doneAnd now Lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy wordBy stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child JesusAnd when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldnessAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things commonAnd with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them allNeither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were soldAnd laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had needAnd Joses who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is being interpreted The son of consolation a Levite and of the country of CyprusHaving land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feetBut a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira his wife sold a possessionAnd kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feetBut Peter said Ananias why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the landWhiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto GodAnd Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these thingsAnd the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried himAnd it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came inAnd Peter answered unto her Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much And she said Yea for so muchThen Peter said unto her How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee outThen fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husbandAnd great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these thingsAnd by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in Solomons porchAnd of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified themAnd believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and womenInsomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of themThere came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every oneThen the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignationAnd laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prisonBut the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and saidGo stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this lifeAnd when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught But the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them broughtBut when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and toldSaying The prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man withinNow when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would growThen came one and told them saying Behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the peopleThen went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stonedAnd when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked themSaying Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon usThen Peter and the other apostles answered and said We ought to obey God rather than menThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a treeHim hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sinsAnd we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey himWhen they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay themThen stood there up one in the council a Pharisee named Gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little spaceAnd said unto them Ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these menFor before these days rose up Theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to noughtAfter this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersedAnd now I say unto you Refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to noughtBut if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against GodAnd to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them goAnd they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his nameAnd daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus ChristAnd in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministrationThen the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tablesWherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this businessBut we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the wordAnd the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas a proselyte of AntiochWhom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on themAnd the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faithAnd Stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the peopleThen there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of them of Cilicia and of Asia disputing with StephenAnd they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spakeThen they suborned men which said We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against GodAnd they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the councilAnd set up false witnesses which said This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the lawFor we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered usAnd all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angelThen said the high priest Are these things soAnd he said Men brethren and fathers hearken The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in CharranAnd said unto him Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which I shall shew theeThen came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans and dwelt in Charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwellAnd he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no childAnd God spake on this wise That his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred yearsAnd the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge said God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this placeAnd he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchsAnd the patriarchs moved with envy sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with himAnd delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he made him governor over Egypt and all his houseNow there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenanceBut when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt he sent out our fathers firstAnd at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren and Josephs kindred was made known unto PharaohThen sent Joseph and called his father Jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen soulsSo Jacob went down into Egypt and died he and our fathersAnd were carried over into Sychem and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of SychemBut when the time of the promise drew nigh which God had sworn to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in EgyptTill another king arose which knew not JosephThe same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not liveIn which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his fathers house three monthsAnd when he was cast out Pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own sonAnd Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deedsAnd when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of IsraelAnd seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the EgyptianFor he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them but they understood notAnd the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying Sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to anotherBut he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying Who made thee a ruler and a judge over usWilt thou kill me as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterdayThen fled Moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of Madian where he begat two sonsAnd when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bushWhen Moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the Lord came unto himSaying I am the God of thy fathers the God of Abrham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob Then Moses trembled and durst not beholdThen said the Lord to him Put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy groundI have seen I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them And now come I will send thee into EgyptThis Moses whom they refused saying Who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bushHe brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red sea and in the wilderness forty yearsThis is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hearThis is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto usTo whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into EgyptSaying unto Aaron Make us gods to go before us for as for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt we wot not what is become of himAnd they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own handsThen God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets O ye house of Israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wildernessYea ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Remphan figures which ye made to worship them and I will carry you away beyond BabylonOur fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seenWhich also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of DavidWho found favour before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of JacobBut Solomon built him an houseHowbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophetHeaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my restHath not my hand made all these thingsYe stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do yeWhich of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderersWho have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept itWhen they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teethBut he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of GodAnd said Behold I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of GodThen they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accordAnd cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was SaulAnd they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spiritAnd he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge And when he had said this he fell asleepAnd Saul was consenting unto his death And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria except the apostlesAnd devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over himAs for Saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prisonTherefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the wordThen Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto themAnd the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he didFor unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healedAnd there was great joy in that cityBut there was a certain man called Simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great oneTo whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying This man is the great power of GodAnd to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceriesBut when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and womenThen Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were doneNow when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and JohnWho when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy GhostFor as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord JesusThen laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy GhostAnd when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them moneySaying Give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy GhostBut Peter said unto him Thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with moneyThou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of GodRepent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven theeFor I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquityThen answered Simon and said Pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon meAnd they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the SamaritansAnd the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying Arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is desertAnd he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worshipWas returning and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophetThen the Spirit said unto Philip Go near and join thyself to this chariotAnd Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Esaias and said Understandest thou what thou readestAnd he said How can I except some man should guide me And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with himThe place of the scripture which he read was this He was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouthIn his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earthAnd the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other manThen Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him JesusAnd as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said See here is water what doth hinder me to be baptizedAnd Philip said If thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest And he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of GodAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he baptized himAnd when they were come up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicingBut Philip was found at Azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to CaesareaAnd Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priestAnd desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto JerusalemAnd as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heavenAnd he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou meAnd he said Who art thou Lord And the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricksAnd he trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me to do And the Lord said unto him Arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must doAnd the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no manAnd Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into DamascusAnd he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drinkAnd there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision Ananias And he said Behold I am here LordAnd the Lord said unto him Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayethAnd hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sightThen Ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at JerusalemAnd here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy nameBut the Lord said unto him Go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of IsraelFor I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sakeAnd Ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said Brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy GhostAnd immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptizedAnd when he had received meat he was strengthened Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at DamascusAnd straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of GodBut all that heard him were amazed and said Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priestsBut Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very ChristAnd after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill himBut their laying await was known of Saul And they watched the gates day and night to kill himThen the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basketAnd when Saul was come to Jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a discipleBut Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of JesusAnd he was with them coming in and going out at JerusalemAnd he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Grecians but they went about to slay himWhich when the brethren knew they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to TarsusThen had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multipliedAnd it came to pass as Peter passed throughout all quarters he came down also to the saints which dwelt at LyddaAnd there he found a certain man named Aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsyAnd Peter said unto him Aeneas Jesus Christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed And he arose immediatelyAnd all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the LordNow there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she didAnd it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamberAnd forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to themThen Peter arose and went with them When he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with themBut Peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise And she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat upAnd he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her aliveAnd it was known throughout all Joppa and many believed in the LordAnd it came to pass that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tannerThere was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius a centurion of the band called the Italian bandA devout man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alwayHe saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying unto him CorneliusAnd when he looked on him he was afraid and said What is it Lord And he said unto him Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before GodAnd now send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose surname is PeterHe lodgeth with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doAnd when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continuallyAnd when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to JoppaOn the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hourAnd he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a tranceAnd saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earthWherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the airAnd there came a voice to him Rise Peter kill and eatBut Peter said Not so Lord for I have never eaten any thing that is common or uncleanAnd the voice spake unto him again the second time What God hath cleansed that call not thou commonThis was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heavenNow while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simons house and stood before the gateAnd called and asked whether Simon which was surnamed Peter were lodged thereWhile Peter thought on the vision the Spirit said unto him Behold three men seek theeArise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for I have sent themThen Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius and said Behold I am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are comeAnd they said Cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of theeThen called he them in and lodged them And on the morrow Peter went away with them and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied himAnd the morrow after they entered into Caesarea And Cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friendsAnd as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped himBut Peter took him up saying Stand up I myself also am a manAnd as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come togetherAnd he said unto them Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or uncleanTherefore came I unto you without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for meAnd Cornelius said Four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothingAnd said Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of GodSend therefore to Joppa and call hither Simon whose surname is Peter he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto theeImmediately therefore I sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come Now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of GodThen Peter opened his mouth and said Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of personsBut in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with himThe word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of allThat word I say ye know which was published throughout all Judaea and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preachedHow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with himAnd we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a treeHim God raised up the third day and shewed him openlyNot to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the deadAnd he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and deadTo him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sinsWhile Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the wordAnd they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy GhostFor they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God Then answered PeterCan any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as weAnd he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Then prayed they him to tarry certain daysAnd the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of GodAnd when Peter was come up to Jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with himSaying Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with themBut Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them sayingI was in the city of Joppa praying and in a trance I saw a vision A certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to meUpon the which when I had fastened mine eyes I considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the airAnd I heard a voice saying unto me Arise Peter slay and eatBut I said Not so Lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouthBut the voice answered me again from heaven What God hath cleansed that call not thou commonAnd this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heavenAnd behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was sent from Caesarea unto meAnd the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting Moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans houseAnd he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him Send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose surname is PeterWho shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be savedAnd as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginningThen remembered I the word of the Lord how that he said John indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy GhostForasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand GodWhen they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God saying Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto lifeNow they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word to none but unto the Jews onlyAnd some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene which when they were come to Antioch spake unto the Grecians preaching the Lord JesusAnd the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the LordThen tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as AntiochWho when he came and had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the LordFor he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the LordThen departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek SaulAnd when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch And it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people And the disciples were called Christians first in AntiochAnd in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto AntiochAnd there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius CaesarThen the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in JudaeaWhich also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and SaulNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the churchAnd he killed James the brother of John with the swordAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also Then were the days of unleavened breadAnd when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the peoplePeter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for himAnd when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prisonAnd behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up saying Arise up quickly And his chains fell off from his handsAnd the angel said unto him Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals And so he did And he saith unto him Cast thy garment about thee and follow meAnd he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a visionWhen they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from himAnd when Peter was come to himself he said Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the JewsAnd when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark where many were gathered together prayingAnd as Peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named RhodaAnd when she knew Peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how Peter stood before the gateAnd they said unto her Thou art mad But she constantly affirmed that it was even so Then said they It is his angelBut Peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonishedBut he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison And he said Go shew these things unto James and to the brethren And he departed and went into another placeNow as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of PeterAnd when Herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and there abodeAnd Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made Blastus the kings chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the kings countryAnd upon a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto themAnd the people gave a shout saying It is the voice of a god and not of a manAnd immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghostBut the word of God grew and multipliedAnd Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them John whose surname was MarkNow there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and SaulAs they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called themAnd when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them awaySo they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed unto Seleucia and from thence they sailed to CyprusAnd when they were at Salamis they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews and they had also John to their ministerAnd when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a Jew whose name was Bar-jesusWhich was with the deputy of the country Sergius Paulus a prudent man who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of GodBut Elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faithThen Saul who also is called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on himAnd said O full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the LordAnd now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the handThen the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the LordNow when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos they came to Perga in Pamphylia and John departing from them returned to JerusalemBut when they departed from Perga they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat downAnd after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying Ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say onThen Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said Men of Israel and ye that fear God give audienceThe God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of itAnd about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wildernessAnd when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan he divided their land to them by lotAnd after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until Samuel the prophetAnd afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of forty yearsAnd when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my willOf this mans seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour JesusWhen John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of IsraelAnd as John fulfilled his course he said Whom think ye that I am I am not he But behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to looseMen and brethren children of the stock of Abraham and whosoever among you feareth God to you is the word of this salvation sentFor they that dwell at Jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning himAnd though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they Pilate that he should be slainAnd when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchreBut God raised him from the deadAnd he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the peopleAnd we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathersGod hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm Thou art my Son this day have I begotten theeAnd as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise I will give you the sure mercies of DavidWherefore he saith also in another psalm Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruptionFor David after he had served his own generation by the will of God fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruptionBut he whom God raised again saw no corruptionBe it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sinsAnd by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of MosesBeware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophetsBehold ye despisers and wonder and perish for I work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto youAnd when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbathNow when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of GodAnd the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of GodBut when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blasphemingThen Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the GentilesFor so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earthAnd when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believedAnd the word of the Lord was published throughout all the regionBut the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their coastsBut they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto IconiumAnd the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy GhostAnd it came to pass in Iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believedBut the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethrenLong time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their handsBut the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the Jews and part with the apostlesAnd when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone themThey were ware of it and fled unto Lystra and Derbe cities of Lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round aboutAnd there they preached the gospelAnd there sat a certain man at Lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walkedThe same heard Paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healedSaid with a loud voice Stand upright on thy feet And he leaped and walkedAnd when the people saw what Paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of Lycaonia The gods are come down to us in the likeness of menAnd they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercurius because he was the chief speakerThen the priest of Jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the peopleWhich when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying outAnd saying Sirs why do ye these things We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are thereinWho in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own waysNevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladnessAnd with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto themAnd there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been deadHowbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to DerbeAnd when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and AntiochConfirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of GodAnd when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord on whom they believedAnd after they had passed throughout Pisidia they came to PamphyliaAnd when they had preached the word in Perga they went down into AttaliaAnd thence sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilledAnd when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the GentilesAnd there they abode long time with the disciplesAnd certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren and said Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be savedWhen therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this questionAnd being brought on their way by the church they passed through Phenice and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethrenAnd when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with themBut there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed saying That it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of MosesAnd the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matterAnd when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them Men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believeAnd God which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto usAnd put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faithNow therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bearBut we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as theyThen all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by themAnd after they had held their peace James answered saying Men and brethren hearken unto meSimeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his nameAnd to this agree the words of the prophets as it is writtenAfter this I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it upThat the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these thingsKnown unto God are all his works from the beginning of the worldWherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to GodBut that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from bloodFor Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath dayThen pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas chief men among the brethrenAnd they wrote letters by them after this manner The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and CiliciaForasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying Ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandmentIt seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and PaulMen that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus ChristWe have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouthFor it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary thingsThat ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well Fare ye wellSo when they were dismissed they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistleWhich when they had read they rejoiced for the consolationAnd Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed themAnd after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostlesNotwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there stillPaul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others alsoAnd some days after Paul said unto Barnabas Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they doAnd Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was MarkBut Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from Pamphylia and went not with them to the workAnd the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto CyprusAnd Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of GodAnd he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churchesThen came he to Derbe and Lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named Timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess and believed but his father was a GreekWhich was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and IconiumHim would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a GreekAnd as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at JerusalemAnd so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number dailyNow when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in AsiaAfter they were come to Mysia they assayed to go into Bithynia but the Spirit suffered them notAnd they passing by Mysia came down to TroasAnd a vision appeared to Paul in the night There stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying Come over into Macedonia and help usAnd after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto themTherefore loosing from Troas we came with a straight course to Samothracia and the next day to NeapolisAnd from thence to Philippi which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain daysAnd on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thitherAnd a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira which worshipped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of PaulAnd when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide there And she constrained usAnd it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsayingThe same followed Paul and us and cried saying These men are the servants of the most high God which shew unto us the way of salvationAnd this did she many days But Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her And he came out the same hourAnd when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulersAnd brought them to the magistrates saying These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our cityAnd teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being RomansAnd the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat themAnd when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safelyWho having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocksAnd at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard themAnd suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosedAnd the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fledBut Paul cried with a loud voice saying Do thyself no harm for we are all hereThen he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and SilasAnd brought them out and said Sirs what must I do to be savedAnd they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy houseAnd they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his houseAnd he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightwayAnd when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God with all his houseAnd when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying Let those men goAnd the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul The magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peaceBut Paul said unto them They have beaten us openly uncondemned being Romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us outAnd the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were RomansAnd they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the cityAnd they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departedNow when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where was a synagogue of the JewsAnd Paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scripturesOpening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is ChristAnd some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas and of the devout Greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a fewBut the Jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the peopleAnd when they found them not they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying These that have turned the world upside down are come hither alsoWhom Jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king one JesusAnd they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these thingsAnd when they had taken security of Jason and of the other they let them goAnd the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the JewsThese were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were soTherefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were Greeks and of men not a fewBut when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea they came thither also and stirred up the peopleAnd then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea but Silas and Timotheus abode there stillAnd they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departedNow while Paul waited for them at Athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatryTherefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with himThen certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoicks encountered him And some said What will this babbler say other some He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrectionAnd they took him and brought him unto Areopagus saying May we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest isFor thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things meanFor all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thingThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill and said Ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitiousFor as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription TO THE UNKNOWN GOD Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare I unto youGod that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with handsNeither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all thingsAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitationThat they should seek the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of usFor in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said For we are also his offspringForasmuch then as we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans deviceAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repentBecause he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the deadAnd when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said We will hear thee again of this matterSo Paul departed from among themHowbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with themAfter these things Paul departed from Athens and came to CorinthAnd found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontus lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome and came unto themAnd because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakersAnd he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the GreeksAnd when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was ChristAnd when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them Your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from henceforth I will go unto the GentilesAnd he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house named Justus one that worshipped God whose house joined hard to the synagogueAnd Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptizedThen spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision Be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peaceFor I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this cityAnd he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among themAnd when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgment seatSaying This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the lawAnd when Paul was now about to open his mouth Gallio said unto the Jews If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness O ye Jews reason would that I should bear with youBut if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for I will be no judge of such mattersAnd he drave them from the judgment seatThen all the Greeks took Sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat And Gallio cared for none of those thingsAnd Paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his head in Cenchrea for he had a vowAnd he came to Ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the JewsWhen they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented notBut bade them farewell saying I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return again unto you if God will And he sailed from EphesusAnd when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to AntiochAnd after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order strengthening all the disciplesAnd a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to EphesusThis man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of JohnAnd he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectlyAnd when he was disposed to pass into Achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through graceFor he mightily convinced the Jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was ChristAnd it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding certain disciplesHe said unto them Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed And they said unto him We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy GhostAnd he said unto them Unto what then were ye baptized And they said Unto Johns baptismThen said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ JesusWhen they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord JesusAnd when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesiedAnd all the men were about twelveAnd he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of GodBut when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one TyrannusAnd this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and GreeksAnd God wrought special miracles by the hands of PaulSo that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of themThen certain of the vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preachethAnd there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jew and chief of the priests which did soAnd the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are yeAnd the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and woundedAnd this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnifiedAnd many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deedsMany of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silverSo mightily grew the word of God and prevailedAfter these things were ended Paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem saying After I have been there I must also see RomeSo he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him Timotheus and Erastus but he himself stayed in Asia for a seasonAnd the same time there arose no small stir about that wayFor a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for Diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmenWhom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said Sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealthMoreover ye see and hear that not alone at Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with handsSo that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all Asia and the world worshippethAnd when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying Great is Diana of the EphesiansAnd the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia Pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatreAnd when Paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him notAnd certain of the chief of Asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatreSome therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come togetherAnd they drew Alexander out of the multitude the Jews putting him forward And Alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the peopleBut when they knew that he was a Jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out Great is Diana of the EphesiansAnd when the townclerk had appeased the people he said Ye men of Ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana and of the image which fell down from JupiterSeeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashlyFor ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddessWherefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one anotherBut if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assemblyFor we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourseAnd when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assemblyAnd after the uproar was ceased Paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into MacedoniaAnd when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into GreeceAnd there abode three months And when the Jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into Syria he purposed to return through MacedoniaAnd there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius of Derbe and Timotheus and of Asia Tychicus and TrophimusThese going before tarried for us at TroasAnd we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to Troas in five days where we abode seven daysAnd upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnightAnd there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered togetherAnd there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up deadAnd Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said Trouble not yourselves for his life is in himWhen he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departedAnd they brought the young man alive and were not a little comfortedAnd we went before to ship and sailed unto Assos there intending to take in Paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afootAnd when he met with us at Assos we took him in and came to MityleneAnd we sailed thence and came the next day over against Chios and the next day we arrived at Samos and tarried at Trogyllium and the next day we came to MiletusFor Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus because he would not spend the time in Asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem the day of PentecostAnd from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the churchAnd when they were come to him he said unto them Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia after what manner I have been with you at all seasonsServing the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the JewsAnd how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to houseTestifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus ChristAnd now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me thereSave that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide meBut none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of GodAnd now behold I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no moreWherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all menFor I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of GodTake heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own bloodFor I know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flockAlso of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after themTherefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tearsAnd now brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctifiedI have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparelYea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with meI have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said It is more blessed to give than to receiveAnd when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them allAnd they all wept sore and fell on Pauls neck and kissed himSorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more And they accompanied him unto the shipAnd it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto Coos and the day following unto Rhodes and from thence unto PataraAnd finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia we went aboard and set forthNow when we had discovered Cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into Syria and landed at Tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burdenAnd finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to JerusalemAnd when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayedAnd when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home againAnd when we had finished our course from Tyre we came to Ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one dayAnd the next day we that were of Pauls company departed and came unto Caesarea and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with himAnd the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesyAnd as we tarried there many days there came down from Judaea a certain prophet named AgabusAnd when he was come unto us he took Pauls girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said Thus saith the Holy Ghost So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the GentilesAnd when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to JerusalemThen Paul answered What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for I am ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord JesusAnd when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying The will of the Lord be doneAnd after those days we took up our carriages and went up to JerusalemThere went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodgeAnd when we were come to Jerusalem the brethren received us gladlyAnd the day following Paul went in with us unto James and all the elders were presentAnd when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministryAnd when they heard it they glorified the Lord and said unto him Thou seest brother how many thousands of Jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the lawAnd they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customsWhat is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art comeDo therefore this that we say to thee We have four men which have a vow on themThem take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the lawAs touching the Gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornicationThen Paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation until that an offering should be offered for every one of themAnd when the seven days were almost ended the Jews which were of Asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on himCrying out Men of Israel help This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought Greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy placeFor they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the templeAnd all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shutAnd as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was in an uproarWho immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of PaulThen the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had doneAnd some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castleAnd when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the peopleFor the multitude of the people followed after crying Away with himAnd as Paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain May I speak unto thee Who said Canst thou speak GreekArt not thou that Egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderersBut Paul said I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus a city in Cilicia a citizen of no mean city and I beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the peopleAnd when he had given him licence Paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people And when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue sayingMen brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which I make now unto youAnd when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saithI am verily a man which am a Jew born in Tarsus a city in Cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward God as ye all are this dayAnd I persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and womenAs also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also I received letters unto the brethren and went to Damascus to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem for to be punishedAnd it came to pass that as I made my journey and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about meAnd I fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecutest thou meAnd I answered Who art thou Lord And he said unto me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutestAnd they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to meAnd I said What shall I do Lord And the Lord said unto me Arise and go into Damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to doAnd when I could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into DamascusAnd one Ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt thereCame unto me and stood and said unto me Brother Saul receive thy sight And the same hour I looked up upon himAnd he said The God of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that Just One and shouldest hear the voice of his mouthFor thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heardAnd now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the LordAnd it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a tranceAnd saw him saying unto me Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning meAnd I said Lord they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on theeAnd when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed I also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew himAnd he said unto me Depart for I will send thee far hence unto the GentilesAnd they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said Away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should liveAnd as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the airThe chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against himAnd as they bound him with thongs Paul said unto the centurion that stood by Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemnedWhen the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying Take heed what thou doest for this man is a RomanThen the chief captain came and said unto him Tell me art thou a Roman He said YeaAnd the chief captain answered With a great sum obtained I this freedom And Paul said But I was free bornThen straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound himOn the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought Paul down and set him before themAnd Paul earnestly beholding the council said Men and brethren I have lived in all good conscience before God until this dayAnd the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouthThen said Paul unto him God shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the lawAnd they that stood by said Revilest thou Gods high priestThen said Paul I wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy peopleBut when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the council Men and brethren I am a Pharisee the son of a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in questionAnd when he had so said there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the multitude was dividedFor the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the Pharisees confess bothAnd there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the Pharisees part arose and strove saying We find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against GodAnd when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castleAnd the night following the Lord stood by him and said Be of good cheer Paul for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at RomeAnd when it was day certain of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed PaulAnd they were more than forty which had made this conspiracyAnd they came to the chief priests and elders and said We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain PaulNow therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill himAnd when Pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told PaulThen Paul called one of the centurions unto him and said Bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell himSo he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said Paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto theeThen the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him What is that thou hast to tell meAnd he said The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectlyBut do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from theeSo the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to meAnd he called unto him two centurions saying Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the nightAnd provide them beasts that they may set Paul on and bring him safe unto Felix the governorAnd he wrote a letter after this mannerClaudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greetingThis man was taken of the Jews and should have been killed of them then came I with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a RomanAnd when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him I brought him forth into their councilWhom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bondsAnd when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man I sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him FarewellThen the soldiers as it was commanded them took Paul and brought him by night to AntipatrisOn the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castleWho when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented Paul also before himAnd when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was And when he understood that he was of CiliciaI will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come And he commanded him to be kept in Herods judgment hallAnd after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named Tertullus who informed the governor against PaulAnd when he was called forth Tertullus began to accuse him saying Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providenceWe accept it always and in all places most noble Felix with all thankfulnessNotwithstanding that I be not further tedious unto thee I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few wordsFor we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the NazarenesWho also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our lawBut the chief captain Lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our handsCommanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse himAnd the Jews also assented saying that these things were soThen Paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation I do the more cheerfully answer for myselfBecause that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worshipAnd they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the cityNeither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse meBut this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the God of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophetsAnd have hope toward God which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjustAnd herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward menNow after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offeringsWhereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumultWho ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against meOr else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while I stood before the councilExcept it be for this one voice that I cried standing among them Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this dayAnd when Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said When Lysias the chief captain shall come down I will know the uttermost of your matterAnd he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto himAnd after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla which was a Jewess he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in ChristAnd as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come Felix trembled and answered Go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for theeHe hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with himBut after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix room and Felix willing to shew the Jews a pleasure left Paul boundNow when Festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from Caesarea to JerusalemThen the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul and besought himAnd desired favour against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill himBut Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thitherLet them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in himAnd when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto Caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be broughtAnd when he was come the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul which they could not proveWhile he answered for himself Neither against the law of the Jews neither against the temple nor yet against Caesar have I offended any thing at allBut Festus willing to do the Jews a pleasure answered Paul and said Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things before meThen said Paul I stand at Caesars judgment seat where I ought to be judged to the Jews have I done no wrong as thou very well knowestFor if I be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death I refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them I appeal unto CaesarThen Festus when he had conferred with the council answered Hast thou appealed unto Caesar unto Caesar shalt thou goAnd after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute FestusAnd when they had been there many days Festus declared Pauls cause unto the king saying There is a certain man left in bonds by FelixAbout whom when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me desiring to have judgment against himTo whom I answered It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against himTherefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forthAgainst whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as I supposedBut had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one Jesus which was dead whom Paul affirmed to be aliveAnd because I doubted of such manner of questions I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these mattersBut when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to CaesarThen Agrippa said unto Festus I would also hear the man myself To morrow said he thou shalt hear himAnd on the morrow when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at Festus commandment Paul was brought forthAnd Festus said King Agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me both at Jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longerBut when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus I have determined to send himOf whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord Wherefore I have brought him forth before you and specially before thee O king Agrippa that after examination had I might have somewhat to writeFor it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against himThen Agrippa said unto Paul Thou art permitted to speak for thyself Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himselfI think myself happy king Agrippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the JewsEspecially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patientlyMy manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem know all the JewsWhich knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a PhariseeAnd now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathersUnto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come For which hopes sake king Agrippa I am accused of the JewsWhy should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the deadI verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of NazarethWhich thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the saints did I shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my voice against themAnd I punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them I persecuted them even unto strange citiesWhereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priestsAt midday O king I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with meAnd when we were all fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricksAnd I said Who art thou Lord And he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutestBut rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto theeDelivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send theeTo open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in meWhereupon O king Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the heavenly visionBut shewed first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of Judaea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do works meet for repentanceFor these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill meHaving therefore obtained help of God I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should comeThat Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the GentilesAnd as he thus spake for himself Festus said with a loud voice Paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee madBut he said I am not mad most noble Festus but speak forth the words of truth and sobernessFor the king knoweth of these things before whom also I speak freely for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a cornerKing Agrippa believest thou the prophets I know that thou believestThen Agrippa said unto Paul Almost thou persuadest me to be a ChristianAnd Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as I am except these bondsAnd when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with themAnd when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bondsThen said Agrippa unto Festus This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto CaesarAnd when it was determined that we should sail into Italy they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius a centurion of Augustus bandAnd entering into a ship of Adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia one Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with usAnd the next day we touched at Sidon And Julius courteously entreated Paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himselfAnd when we had launched from thence we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contraryAnd when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra a city of LyciaAnd there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy and he put us thereinAnd when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against Cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under Crete over against SalmoneAnd hardly passing it came unto a place which is called The fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of LaseaNow when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past Paul admonished themAnd said unto them Sirs I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our livesNevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by PaulAnd because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to Phenice and there to winter which is an haven of Crete and lieth toward the south west and north westAnd when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by CreteBut not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called EuroclydonAnd when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her driveAnd running under a certain island which is called Clauda we had much work to come by the boatWhich when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were drivenAnd we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the shipAnd the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the shipAnd when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken awayBut after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said Sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete and to have gained this harm and lossAnd now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you but of the shipFor there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serveSaying Fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with theeWherefore sirs be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told meHowbeit we must be cast upon a certain islandBut when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in Adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some countryAnd sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathomsThen fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the dayAnd as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreshipPaul said to the centurion and to the soldiers Except these abide in the ship ye cannot be savedThen the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall offAnd while the day was coming on Paul besought them all to take meat saying This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothingWherefore I pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of youAnd when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eatThen were they all of good cheer and they also took some meatAnd we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen soulsAnd when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the seaAnd when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the shipAnd when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shoreAnd falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the wavesAnd the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escapeBut the centurion willing to save Paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to landAnd the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship And so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to landAnd when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called MelitaAnd the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the coldAnd when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his handAnd when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves No doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to liveAnd he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harmHowbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a godIn the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was Publius who received us and lodged us three days courteouslyAnd it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed himSo when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healedWho also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessaryAnd after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was Castor and PolluxAnd landing at Syracuse we tarried there three daysAnd from thence we fetched a compass and came to Rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to PuteoliWhere we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward RomeAnd from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum and The three taverns whom when Paul saw he thanked God and took courageAnd when we came to Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept himAnd it came to pass that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together and when they were come together he said unto them Men and brethren though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the RomansWho when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in meBut when the Jews spake against it I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar not that I had ought to accuse my nation ofFor this cause therefore have I called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chainAnd they said unto him We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of theeBut we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken againstAnd when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God persuading them concerning Jesus both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets from morning till eveningAnd some believed the things which were spoken and some believed notAnd when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that Paul had spoken one word Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathersSaying Go unto this people and say Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceiveFor the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal themBe it known therefore unto you that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles and that they will hear itAnd when he had said these words the Jews departed and had great reasoning among themselvesAnd Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto himPreaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding himPaul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of GodWhich he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scripturesConcerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the fleshAnd declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the deadBy whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his nameAmong whom are ye also the called of Jesus ChristTo all that be in Rome beloved of God called to be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristFirst I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole worldFor God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayersMaking request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto youFor I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be establishedThat is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and meNow I would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that I might have some fruit among you also even as among other GentilesI am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwiseSo as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome alsoFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and also to the GreekFor therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written The just shall live by faithFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousnessBecause that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God hath shewed it unto themFor the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuseBecause that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkenedProfessing themselves to be wise they became foolsAnd changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping thingsWherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselvesWho changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed for ever AmenFor this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against natureAnd likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meetAnd even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenientBeing filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperersBackbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parentsWithout understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmercifulWho knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do themTherefore thou art inexcusable O man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same thingsBut we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such thingsAnd thinkest thou this O man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of GodOr despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentanceBut after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of GodWho will render to every man according to his deedsTo them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal lifeBut unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrathTribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the Jew first and also of the GentileBut glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the GentileFor there is no respect of persons with GodFor as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the lawFor not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justifiedFor when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselvesWhich shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one anotherIn the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospelBehold thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of GodAnd knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the lawAnd art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darknessAn instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the lawThou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou stealThou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilegeThou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou GodFor the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you as it is writtenFor circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcisionTherefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcisionAnd shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the lawFor he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the fleshBut he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of GodWhat advantage then hath the Jew or what profit is there of circumcisionMuch every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of GodFor what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effectGod forbid yea let God be true but every man a liar as it is written That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judgedBut if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God what shall we say Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance I speak as a manGod forbid for then how shall God judge the worldFor if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am I also judged as a sinnerAnd not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say Let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is justWhat then are we better than they No in no wise for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sinAs it is written There is none righteous no not oneThere is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after GodThey are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not oneTheir throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lipsWhose mouth is full of cursing and bitternessTheir feet are swift to shed bloodDestruction and misery are in their waysAnd the way of peace have they not knownThere is no fear of God before their eyesNow we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before GodTherefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sinBut now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophetsEven the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no differenceFor all have sinned and come short of the glory of GodBeing justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ JesusWhom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of GodTo declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in JesusWhere is boasting then It is excluded By what law of works Nay but by the law of faithTherefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the lawIs he the God of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles Yes of the Gentiles alsoSeeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faithDo we then make void the law through faith God forbid yea we establish the lawWhat shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath foundFor if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before GodFor what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousnessNow to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debtBut to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousnessEven as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without worksSaying Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are coveredBlessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sinCometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousnessHow was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision Not in circumcision but in uncircumcisionAnd he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them alsoAnd the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcisedFor the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faithFor if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effectBecause the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgressionTherefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us allAs it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they wereWho against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken So shall thy seed beAnd being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Saras wombHe staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to GodAnd being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to performAnd therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnessNow it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to himBut for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the deadWho was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justificationTherefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus ChristBy whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of GodAnd not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patienceAnd patience experience and experience hopeAnd hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto usFor when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodlyFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to dieBut God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for usMuch more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through himFor if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his lifeAnd not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonementWherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinnedFor until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no lawNevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to comeBut not as the offence so also is the free gift For if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto manyAnd not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justificationFor if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus ChristTherefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of lifeFor as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteousMoreover the law entered that the offence might abound But where sin abounded grace did much more aboundThat as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our LordWhat shall we say then Shall we continue in sin that grace may aboundGod forbid How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer thereinKnow ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his deathTherefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of lifeFor if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrectionKnowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sinFor he that is dead is freed from sinNow if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with himKnowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over himFor in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto GodLikewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our LordLet not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereofNeither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto GodFor sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under graceWhat then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbidKnow ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousnessBut God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered youBeing then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousnessI speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holinessFor when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousnessWhat fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is deathBut now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting lifeFor the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our LordKnow ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he livethFor the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husbandSo then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another manWherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto GodFor when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto deathBut now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letterWhat shall we say then Is the law sin God forbid Nay I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covetBut sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence For without the law sin was deadFor I was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and I diedAnd the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto deathFor sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew meWherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and goodWas then that which is good made death unto me God forbid But sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinfulFor we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sinFor that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do IIf then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is goodNow then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in meFor I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find notFor the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I doNow if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in meI find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with meFor I delight in the law of God after the inward manBut I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my membersO wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this deathI thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sinThere is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the SpiritFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and deathFor what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the fleshThat the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the SpiritFor they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the Spirit the things of the SpiritFor to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peaceBecause the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can beSo then they that are in the flesh cannot please GodBut ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of hisAnd if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousnessBut if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in youTherefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the fleshFor if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall liveFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of GodFor ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba FatherThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of GodAnd if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified togetherFor I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in usFor the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of GodFor the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hopeBecause the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of GodFor we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until nowAnd not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our bodyFor we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope forBut if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for itLikewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be utteredAnd he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of GodAnd we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purposeFor whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son that he might be the firstborn among many brethrenMoreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorifiedWhat shall we then say to these things If God be for us who can be against usHe that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all thingsWho shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect It is God that justifiethWho is he that condemneth It is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for usWho shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or swordAs it is written For thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughterNay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved usFor I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to comeNor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our LordI say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy GhostThat I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heartFor I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the fleshWho are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promisesWhose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever AmenNot as though the word of God hath taken none effect For they are not all Israel which are of IsraelNeither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but In Isaac shall thy seed be calledThat is They which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seedFor this is the word of promise At this time will I come and Sara shall have a sonAnd not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father IsaacFor the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that callethIt was said unto her The elder shall serve the youngerAs it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hatedWhat shall we say then Is there unrighteousness with God God forbidFor he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassionSo then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that sheweth mercyFor the scripture saith unto Pharaoh Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earthTherefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardenethThou wilt say then unto me Why doth he yet find fault For who hath resisted his willNay but O man who art thou that repliest against God Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it Why hast thou made me thusHath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonourWhat if God willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destructionAnd that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto gloryEven us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the GentilesAs he saith also in Osee I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not belovedAnd it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them Ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living GodEsaias also crieth concerning Israel Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be savedFor he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earthAnd as Esaias said before Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as Sodoma and been made like unto GomorrhaWhat shall we say then That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faithBut Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousnessWherefore Because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law For they stumbled at that stumblingstoneAs it is written Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamedBrethren my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be savedFor I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledgeFor they being ignorant of Gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of GodFor Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believethFor Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law That the man which doeth those things shall live by themBut the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise Say not in thine heart Who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from aboveOr Who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the deadBut what saith it The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preachThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be savedFor with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvationFor the scripture saith Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamedFor there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon himFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be savedHow then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacherAnd how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good thingsBut they have not all obeyed the gospel For Esaias saith Lord who hath believed our reportSo then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of GodBut I say Have they not heard Yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the worldBut I say Did not Israel know First Moses saith I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation I will anger youBut Esaias is very bold and saith I was found of them that sought me not I was made manifest unto them that asked not after meBut to Israel he saith All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying peopleI say then Hath God cast away his people God forbid For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of BenjaminGod hath not cast away his people which he foreknew Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel sayingLord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my lifeBut what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of BaalEven so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of graceAnd if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace But if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more workWhat then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blindedAccording as it is written God hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this dayAnd David saith Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompence unto themLet their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alwayI say then Have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousyNow if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fulnessFor I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine officeIf by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of themFor if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the deadFor if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branchesAnd if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive treeBoast not against the branches But if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root theeThou wilt say then The branches were broken off that I might be graffed inWell because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith Be not highminded but fearFor if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not theeBehold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut offAnd they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for God is able to graff them in againFor if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive treeFor I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be come inAnd so all Israel shall be saved as it is written There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from JacobFor this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sinsAs concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakesFor the gifts and calling of God are without repentanceFor as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained mercy through their unbeliefEven so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercyFor God hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon allO the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding outFor who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his counsellerOr who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him againFor of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever AmenI beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable serviceAnd be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of GodFor I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faithFor as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same officeSo we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of anotherHaving then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faithOr ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teachingOr he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulnessLet love be without dissimulation Abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is goodBe kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one anotherNot slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the LordRejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayerDistributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitalityBless them which persecute you bless and curse notRejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weepBe of the same mind one toward another Mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate Be not wise in your own conceitsRecompense to no man evil for evil Provide things honest in the sight of all menIf it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all menDearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay saith the LordTherefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his headBe not overcome of evil but overcome evil with goodLet every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of GodWhosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnationFor rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the sameFor he is the minister of God to thee for good But if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evilWherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sakeFor for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are Gods ministers attending continually upon this very thingRender therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honourOwe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the lawFor this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyselfLove worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the lawAnd that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believedThe night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of lightLet us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envyingBut put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereofHim that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputationsFor one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbsLet not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received himWho art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own master he standeth or falleth Yea he shall be holden up for God is able to make him standOne man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mindHe that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and he that regardeth not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it He that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanksFor none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himselfFor whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the LordsFor to this end Christ both died and rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and livingBut why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of ChristFor it is written As I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to GodSo then every one of us shall give account of himself to GodLet us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brothers wayI know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is uncleanBut if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ diedLet not then your good be evil spoken ofFor the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy GhostFor he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of menLet us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify anotherFor meat destroy not the work of God All things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offenceIt is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weakHast thou faith have it to thyself before God Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he allowethAnd he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sinWe then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselvesLet every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edificationFor even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on meFor whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hopeNow the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ JesusThat ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the Father of our Lord Jesus ChristWherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to the glory of GodNow I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathersAnd that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy as it is written For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy nameAnd again he saith Rejoice ye Gentiles with his peopleAnd again Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles and laud him all ye peopleAnd again Esaias saith There shall be a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trustNow the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy GhostAnd I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one anotherNevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of GodThat I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy GhostI have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to GodFor I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deedThrough mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of ChristYea so have I strived to preach the gospel not where Christ was named lest I should build upon another mans foundationBut as it is written To whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understandFor which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to youBut now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto youWhensoever I take my journey into Spain I will come to you for I trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first I be somewhat filled with your companyBut now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saintsFor it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at JerusalemIt hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal thingsWhen therefore I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit I will come by you into SpainAnd I am sure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of ChristNow I beseech you brethren for the Lord Jesus Christs sake and for the love of the Spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for meThat I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saintsThat I may come unto you with joy by the will of God and may with you be refreshedNow the God of peace be with you all AmenI commend unto you Phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at CenchreaThat ye receive her in the Lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself alsoGreet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ JesusWho have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the GentilesLikewise greet the church that is in their house Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto ChristGreet Mary who bestowed much labour on usSalute Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in Christ before meGreet Amplias my beloved in the LordSalute Urbane our helper in Christ and Stachys my belovedSalute Apelles approved in Christ Salute them which are of Aristobulus householdSalute Herodion my kinsman Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus which are in the LordSalute Tryphena and Tryphosa who labour in the Lord Salute the beloved Persis which laboured much in the LordSalute Rufus chosen in the Lord and his mother and mineSalute Asyncritus Phlegon Hermas Patrobas Hermes and the brethren which are with themSalute Philologus and Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints which are with themSalute one another with an holy kiss The churches of Christ salute youNow I beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid themFor they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simpleFor your obedience is come abroad unto all men I am glad therefore on your behalf but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evilAnd the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you AmenTimotheus my workfellow and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my kinsmen salute youI Tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the LordGaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and Quartus a brotherThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all AmenNow to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world beganBut now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faithTo God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ for ever AmenPaul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and Sosthenes our brotherUnto the church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and oursGrace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus ChristI thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus ChristThat in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledgeEven as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in youSo that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus ChristWho shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus ChristGod is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our LordNow I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgmentFor it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of Chloe that there are contentions among youNow this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and I of Apollos and I of Cephas and I of ChristIs Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of PaulI thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and GaiusLest any should say that I had baptized in mine own nameAnd I baptized also the household of Stephanas besides I know not whether I baptized any otherFor Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effectFor the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of GodFor it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudentWhere is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this worldFor after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believeFor the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdomBut we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumblingblock and unto the Greeks foolishnessBut unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of GodBecause the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than menFor ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are calledBut God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mightyAnd base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that areThat no flesh should glory in his presenceBut of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemptionThat according as it is written He that glorieth let him glory in the LordAnd I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of GodFor I determined not to know any thing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucifiedAnd I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much tremblingAnd my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of powerThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of GodHowbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to noughtBut we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our gloryWhich none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of gloryBut as it is written Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love himBut God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the Spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of GodFor what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of GodNow we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of GodWhich things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritualBut the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discernedBut he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no manFor who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him But we have the mind of ChristAnd I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in ChristI have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye ableFor ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as menFor while one saith I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are ye not carnalWho then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the Lord gave to every manI have planted Apollos watered but God gave the increaseSo then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but God that giveth the increaseNow he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labourFor we are labourers together with God ye are Gods husbandry ye are Gods buildingAccording to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereuponFor other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus ChristNow if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubbleEvery mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it isIf any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a rewardIf any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fireKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in youIf any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple ye areLet no man deceive himself If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wiseFor the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God For it is written He taketh the wise in their own craftinessAnd again The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vainTherefore let no man glory in men For all things are yoursWhether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yoursAnd ye are Christs and Christ is GodsLet a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of GodMoreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithfulBut with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea I judge not mine own selfFor I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the LordTherefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of GodAnd these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against anotherFor who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received itNow ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and I would to God ye did reign that we also might reign with youFor I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to menWe are fools for Christs sake but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despisedEven unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplaceAnd labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer itBeing defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this dayI write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons I warn youFor though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospelWherefore I beseech you be ye followers of meFor this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach every where in every churchNow some are puffed up as though I would not come to youBut I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the powerFor the kingdom of God is not in word but in powerWhat will ye shall I come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meeknessIt is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his fathers wifeAnd ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among youFor I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath so done this deedIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus ChristTo deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord JesusYour glorying is not good Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpPurge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for usTherefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truthI wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicatorsYet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the worldBut now I have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eatFor what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are withinBut them that are without God judgeth Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked personDare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saintsDo ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest mattersKnow ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this lifeIf then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the churchI speak to your shame Is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethrenBut brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelieversNow therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another Why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defraudedNay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethrenKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankindNor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of GodAnd such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our GodAll things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of anyMeats for the belly and the belly for meats but God shall destroy both it and them Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the bodyAnd God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by his own powerKnow ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot God forbidWhat know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one fleshBut he that is joined unto the Lord is one spiritFlee fornication Every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own bodyWhat know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your ownFor ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are GodsNow concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me It is good for a man not to touch a womanNevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husbandLet the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husbandThe wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wifeDefraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinencyBut I speak this by permission and not of commandmentFor I would that all men were even as I myself But every man hath his proper gift of God one after this manner and another after thatI say therefore to the unmarried and widows It is good for them if they abide even as IBut if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burnAnd unto the married I command yet not I but the Lord Let not the wife depart from her husbandBut and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wifeBut to the rest speak I not the Lord If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her awayAnd the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave himFor the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holyBut if the unbelieving depart let him depart A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to peaceFor what knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou O man whether thou shalt save thy wifeBut as God hath distributed to every man as the Lord hath called every one so let him walk And so ordain I in all churchesIs any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised Is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcisedCircumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of GodLet every man abide in the same calling wherein he was calledArt thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it ratherFor he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is Christs servantYe are bought with a price be not ye the servants of menBrethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with GodNow concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord yet I give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithfulI suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress I say that it is good for a man so to beArt thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed Art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wifeBut and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but I spare youBut this I say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had noneAnd they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed notAnd they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth awayBut I would have you without carefulness He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the LordBut he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wifeThere is difference also between a wife and a virgin The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husbandAnd this I speak for your own profit not that I may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distractionBut if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marryNevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth wellSo then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth betterThe wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the LordBut she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and I think also that I have the Spirit of GodNow as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge Knowledge puffeth up but charity edifiethAnd if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to knowBut if any man love God the same is known of himAs concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other God but oneFor though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords manyBut to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by himHowbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiledBut meat commendeth us not to God for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worseBut take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weakFor if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idolsAnd through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ diedBut when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against ChristWherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offendAm I not an apostle am I not free have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord are not ye my work in the LordIf I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the LordMine answer to them that do examine me is thisHave we not power to eat and to drinkHave we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the Lord and CephasOr I only and Barnabas have not we power to forbear workingWho goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flockSay I these things as a man or saith not the law the same alsoFor it is written in the law of Moses Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn Doth God take care for oxenOr saith he it altogether for our sakes For our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hopeIf we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal thingsIf others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather Nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of ChristDo ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alterEven so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospelBut I have used none of these things neither have I written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying voidFor though I preach the gospel I have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if I preach not the gospelFor if I do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto meWhat is my reward then Verily that when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge that I abuse not my power in the gospelFor though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the moreAnd unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the lawTo them that are without law as without law being not without law to God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without lawTo the weak became I as weak that I might gain the weak I am made all things to all men that I might by all means save someAnd this I do for the gospels sake that I might be partaker thereof with youKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize So run that ye may obtainAnd every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptibleI therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the airBut I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castawayMoreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the seaAnd were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the seaAnd did all eat the same spiritual meatAnd did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them and that Rock was ChristBut with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wildernessNow these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lustedNeither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to playNeither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousandNeither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpentsNeither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyerNow all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are comeWherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fallThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear itWherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatryI speak as to wise men judge ye what I sayThe cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of ChristFor we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one breadBehold Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alterWhat say I then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thingBut I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devilsYe cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the Lords table and of the table of devilsDo we provoke the Lord to jealousy are we stronger than heAll things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify notLet no man seek his own but every man anothers wealthWhatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sakeFor the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereofIf any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sakeBut if any man say unto you This is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereofConscience I say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscienceFor if I by grace be a partaker why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanksWhether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of GodGive none offence neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the church of GodEven as I please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be savedBe ye followers of me even as I also am of ChristNow I praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to youBut I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is GodEvery man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his headBut every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shavenFor if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be coveredFor a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the manFor the man is not of the woman but the woman of the manNeither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the manFor this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angelsNevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the LordFor as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of godJudge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncoveredDoth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto himBut if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a coveringBut if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of GodNow in this that I declare unto you I praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worseFor first of all when ye come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe itFor there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among youWhen ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lords supperFor in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunkenWhat have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of God and shame them that have not What shall I say to you shall I praise you in this I praise you notFor I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took breadAnd when he had given thanks he brake it and said Take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of meAfter the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying This cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of meFor as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the Lords death till he comeWherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the LordBut let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cupFor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lords bodyFor this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleepFor if we would judge ourselves we should not be judgedBut when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the worldWherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for anotherAnd if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation And the rest will I set in order when I comeNow concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorantYe know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were ledWherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy GhostNow there are diversities of gifts but the same SpiritAnd there are differences of administrations but the same LordAnd there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in allBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withalFor to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same SpiritTo another faith by the same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same SpiritTo another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tonguesBut all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit dividing to every man severally as he willFor as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is ChristFor by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one SpiritFor the body is not one member but manyIf the foot shall say Because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the bodyAnd if the ear shall say Because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the bodyIf the whole body were an eye where were the hearing If the whole were hearing where were the smellingBut now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased himAnd if they were all one member where were the bodyBut now are they many members yet but one bodyAnd the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of youNay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessaryAnd those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comelinessFor our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lackedThat there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for anotherAnd whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with itNow ye are the body of Christ and members in particularAnd God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tonguesAre all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miraclesHave all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpretBut covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew I unto you a more excellent wayThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbalAnd though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothingAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothingCharity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed upDoth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evilRejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truthBeareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all thingsCharity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish awayFor we know in part and we prophesy in partBut when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done awayWhen I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish thingsFor now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am knownAnd now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charityFollow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesyFor he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteriesBut he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfortHe that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the churchI would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifyingNow brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrineAnd even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harpedFor if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battleSo likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the airThere are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without significationTherefore if I know not the meaning of the voice I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto meEven so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the churchWherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpretFor if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitfulWhat is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding alsoElse when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayestFor thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edifiedI thank my God I speak with tongues more than ye allYet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongueBrethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be menIn the law it is written With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the LordWherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believeIf therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are madBut if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of allAnd thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truthHow is it then brethren when ye come together everyone of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation Let all things be done unto edifyingIf any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpretBut if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to GodLet the prophets speak two or three and let the other judgeIf any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peaceFor ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comfortedAnd the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophetsFor God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saintsLet your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the lawAnd if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the churchWhat came the word of God out from you or came it unto you onlyIf any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the LordBut if any man be ignorant let him be ignorantWherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tonguesLet all things be done decently and in orderMoreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye standBy which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vainFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripturesAnd that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scripturesAnd that he was seen of Cephas then of the twelveAfter that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleepAfter that he was seen of James then of all the apostlesAnd last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due timeFor I am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of GodBut by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I laboured more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with meTherefore whether it were I or they so we preach and so ye believedNow if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the deadBut if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risenAnd if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vainYea and we are found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise notFor if the dead rise not then is not Christ raisedAnd if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sinsThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perishedIf in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserableBut now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that sleptFor since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the deadFor as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made aliveBut every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christs at his comingThen cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and powerFor he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feetThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is deathFor he hath put all things under his feet But when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under himAnd when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in allElse what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the deadAnd why stand we in jeopardy every hourI protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die dailyIf after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we dieBe not deceived evil communications corrupt good mannersAwake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speak this to your shameBut some man will say How are the dead raised up and with what body do they comeThou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dieAnd that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grainBut God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own bodyAll flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birdsThere are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is anotherThere is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glorySo also is the resurrection of the dead It is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruptionIt is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in powerIt is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body There is a natural body and there is a spiritual bodyAnd so it is written The first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spiritHowbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritualThe first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord from heavenAs is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenlyAnd as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenlyNow this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruptionBehold I shew you a mystery We shall not all sleep but we shall all be changedIn a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changedFor this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortalitySo when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victoryO death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victoryThe sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the lawBut thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus ChristTherefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the Lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the LordNow concerning the collection for the saints as I have given order to the churches of Galatia even so do yeUpon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when I comeAnd when I come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will I send to bring your liberality unto JerusalemAnd if it be meet that I go also they shall go with meNow I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia for I do pass through MacedoniaAnd it may be that I will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I goFor I will not see you now by the way but I trust to tarry a while with you if the Lord permitBut I will tarry at Ephesus until PentecostFor a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversariesNow if Timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the Lord as I also doLet no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for I look for him with the brethrenAs touching our brother Apollos I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient timeWatch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strongLet all your things be done with charityI beseech you brethren ye know the house of Stephanas that it is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saintsThat ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and labourethI am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have suppliedFor they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are suchThe churches of Asia salute you Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their houseAll the brethren greet you Greet ye one another with an holy kissThe salutation of me Paul with mine own handIf any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema MaranathaThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with youMy love be with you all in Christ Jesus AmenPaul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy our brother unto the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints which are in all AchaiaGrace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus ChristBlessed be God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of mercies and the God of all comfortWho comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of GodFor as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by ChristAnd whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvationAnd our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolationFor we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of lifeBut we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the deadWho delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver usYe also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalfFor our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you-wardFor we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the endAs also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord JesusAnd in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefitAnd to pass by you into Macedonia and to come again out of Macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward JudaeaWhen I therefore was thus minded did I use lightness or the things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nayBut as God is true our word toward you was not yea and nayFor the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yeaFor all the promises of God in him are yea and in him Amen unto the glory of God by usNow he which stablisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is GodWho hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our heartsMoreover I call God for a record upon my soul that to spare you I came not as yet unto CorinthNot for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye standBut I determined this with myself that I would not come again to you in heavinessFor if I make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by meAnd I wrote this same unto you lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you allFor out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto youBut if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that I may not overcharge you allSufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of manySo that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrowWherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward himFor to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all thingsTo whom ye forgive any thing I forgive also for if I forgave any thing to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of ChristLest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devicesFurthermore when I came to Troas to preach Christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the LordI had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother but taking my leave of them I went from thence into MacedoniaNow thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every placeFor we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perishTo the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life And who is sufficient for these thingsFor we are not as many which corrupt the word of God but as of sincerity but as of God in the sight of God speak we in ChristDo we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from youYe are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all menForasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heartAnd such trust have we through Christ to God-wardNot that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of GodWho also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth lifeBut if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done awayHow shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather gloriousFor if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in gloryFor even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excellethFor if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is gloriousSeeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speechAnd not as Moses which put a vail over his face that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolishedBut their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in ChristBut even unto this day when Moses is read the vail is upon their heartNevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the vail shall be taken awayNow the Lord is that Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is libertyBut we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the LordTherefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint notBut have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of GodBut if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lostIn whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto themFor we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sakeFor God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus ChristBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of usWe are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despairPersecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyedAlways bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodyFor we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal fleshSo then death worketh in us but life in youWe having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speakKnowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with youFor all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of GodFor which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by dayFor our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of gloryWhile we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternalFor we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God an house not made with hands eternal in the heavensFor in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heavenIf so be that being clothed we shall not be found nakedFor we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of lifeNow he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the SpiritTherefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the LordFor we walk by faith not by sightWe are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the LordWherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of himFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or badKnowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciencesFor we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heartFor whether we be beside ourselves it is to God or whether we be sober it is for your causeFor the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all deadAnd that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose againWherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no moreTherefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become newAnd all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliationTo wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliationNow then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to GodFor he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in himWe then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vainFor he saith I have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvationGiving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamedBut in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distressesIn stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastingsBy pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeignedBy the word of truth by the power of God by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the leftBy honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet trueAs unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killedAs sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all thingsO ye Corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlargedYe are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowelsNow for a recompence in the same I speak as unto my children be ye also enlargedBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darknessAnd what concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidelAnd what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the temple of the living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my peopleWherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive youAnd will be a Father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord AlmightyHaving therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of GodReceive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no manI speak not this to condemn you for I have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with youGreat is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you I am filled with comfort I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulationFor when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fearsNevertheless God that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of TitusAnd not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that I rejoiced the moreFor though I made you sorry with a letter I do not repent though I did repent for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a seasonNow I rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothingFor godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh deathFor behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matterWherefore though I wrote unto you I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto youTherefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus because his spirit was refreshed by you allFor if I have boasted any thing to him of you I am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which I made before Titus is found a truthAnd his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received himI rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all thingsMoreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of MacedoniaHow that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberalityFor to their power I bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselvesPraying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saintsAnd this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the Lord and unto us by the will of GodInsomuch that we desired Titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace alsoTherefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace alsoI speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your loveFor ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be richAnd herein I give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year agoNow therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye haveFor if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath notFor I mean not that other men be eased and ye burdenedBut by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equalityAs it is written He that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lackBut thanks be to God which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for youFor indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto youAnd we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churchesAnd not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord and declaration of your ready mindAvoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by usProviding for honest things not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of menAnd we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which I have in youWhether any do inquire of Titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be inquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of ChristWherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalfFor as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to youFor I know the forwardness of your mind for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia that Achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very manyYet have I sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as I said ye may be readyLest haply if they of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boastingTherefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousnessBut this I say He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifullyEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful giverAnd God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good workAs it is written He hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for everNow he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousnessBeing enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to GodFor the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto GodWhiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all menAnd by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in youThanks be unto God for his unspeakable giftNow I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward youBut I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the fleshFor though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the fleshFor the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holdsCasting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of ChristAnd having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilledDo ye look on things after the outward appearance If any man trust to himself that he is Christs let him of himself think this again that as he is Christs even so are we ChristsFor though I should boast somewhat more of our authority which the Lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction I should not be ashamedThat I may not seem as if I would terrify you by lettersFor his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptibleLet such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are presentFor we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wiseBut we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto youFor we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of ChristNot boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantlyTo preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our handBut he that glorieth let him glory in the LordFor not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the Lord commendethWould to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with meFor I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to ChristBut I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in ChristFor if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with himFor I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostlesBut though I be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all thingsHave I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because I have preached to you the gospel of God freelyI robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you serviceAnd when I was present with you and wanted I was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will I keep myselfAs the truth of Christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of AchaiaWherefore because I love you not God knowethBut what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as weFor such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of ChristAnd no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of lightTherefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their worksI say again Let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that I may boast myself a littleThat which I speak I speak it not after the Lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boastingSeeing that many glory after the flesh I will glory alsoFor ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wiseFor ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the faceI speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold alsoAre they Hebrews so am I Are they Israelites so am I Are they the seed of Abraham so am IAre they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oftOf the Jews five times received I forty stripes save oneThrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deepIn journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethrenIn weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakednessBeside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churchesWho is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn notIf I must needs glory I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmitiesThe God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie notIn Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend meAnd through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall and escaped his handsIt is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the LordI knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such an one caught up to the third heavenAnd I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knowethHow that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utterOf such an one will I glory yet of myself I will not glory but in mine infirmitiesFor though I would desire to glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of meAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I should be exalted above measureFor this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from meAnd he said unto me My grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon meTherefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christs sake for when I am weak then am I strongI am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for I ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles though I be nothingTruly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deedsFor what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrongBehold the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burdensome to you for I seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the childrenAnd I will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly I love you the less I be lovedBut be it so I did not burden you nevertheless being crafty I caught you with guileDid I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto youI desired Titus and with him I sent a brother Did Titus make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the same stepsAgain think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before God in Christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifyingFor I fear lest when I come I shall not find you such as I would and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumultsAnd lest when I come again my God will humble me among you and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committedThis is the third time I am coming to you In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be establishedI told you before and foretell you as if I were present the second time and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if I come again I will not spareSince ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me which to you-ward is not weak but is mighty in youFor though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God For we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward youExamine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobatesBut I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobatesNow I pray to God that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobatesFor we can do nothing against the truth but for the truthFor we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfectionTherefore I write these things being absent lest being present I should use sharpness according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification and not to destructionFinally brethren farewell Be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the God of love and peace shall be with youGreet one another with an holy kissAll the saints salute youThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all AmenPaul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the deadAnd all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of GalatiaGrace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus ChristWho gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our FatherTo whom be glory for ever and ever AmenI marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospelWhich is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of ChristBut though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursedAs we said before so say I now again If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursedFor do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of ChristBut I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after manFor I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus ChristFor ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted itAnd profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathersBut when it pleased God who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his graceTo reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and bloodNeither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto DamascusThen after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen daysBut other of the apostles saw I none save James the Lords brotherNow the things which I write unto you behold before God I lie notAfterwards I came into the regions of Syria and CiliciaAnd was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in ChristBut they had heard only That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyedAnd they glorified God in meThen fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me alsoAnd I went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vainBut neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcisedAnd that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondageTo whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with youBut of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me God accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to meBut contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto PeterFor he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the GentilesAnd when James Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcisionOnly they would that we should remember the poor the same which I also was forward to doBut when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamedFor before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcisionAnd the other Jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulationBut when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel I said unto Peter before them all If thou being a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the JewsWe who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the GentilesKnowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justifiedBut if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbidFor if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressorFor I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto GodI am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for meI do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vainO foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among youThis only would I learn of you Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faithAre ye so foolish having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the fleshHave ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vainHe therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faithEven as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousnessKnow ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of AbrahamAnd the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying In thee shall all nations be blessedSo then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful AbrahamFor as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do themBut that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for The just shall live by faithAnd the law is not of faith but The man that doeth them shall live in themChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written Cursed is every one that hangeth on a treeThat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faithBrethren I speak after the manner of men Though it be but a mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth theretoNow to Abraham and his seed were the promises made He saith not And to seeds as of many but as of one And to thy seed which is ChristAnd this I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effectFor if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promiseWherefore then serveth the law It was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediatorNow a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is oneIs the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the lawBut the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believeBut before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealedWherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faithBut after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmasterFor ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ JesusFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on ChristThere is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ JesusAnd if ye be Christs then are ye Abrahams seed and heirs according to the promiseNow I say That the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of allBut is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the fatherEven so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the worldBut when the fulness of the time was come God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the lawTo redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sonsAnd because ye are sons God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts crying Abba FatherWherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through ChristHowbeit then when ye knew not God ye did service unto them which by nature are no godsBut now after that ye have known God or rather are known of God how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondageYe observe days and months and times and yearsI am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vainBrethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as ye are ye have not injured me at allYe know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the firstAnd my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ JesusWhere is then the blessedness ye spake of for I bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to meAm I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truthThey zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect themBut it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when I am present with youMy little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in youI desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for I stand in doubt of youTell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the lawFor it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewomanBut he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promiseWhich things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage which is AgarFor this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her childrenBut Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us allFor it is written Rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husbandNow we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promiseBut as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit even so it is nowNevertheless what saith the scripture Cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewomanSo then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the freeStand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondageBehold I Paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothingFor I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole lawChrist is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from graceFor we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faithFor in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by loveYe did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truthThis persuasion cometh not of him that calleth youA little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpI have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he beAnd I brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceasedI would they were even cut off which trouble youFor brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one anotherFor all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyselfBut if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of anotherThis I say then Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulful the lust of the fleshFor the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye wouldBut if ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the lawNow the works of the flesh are manifest which are these Adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousnessIdolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresiesEnvyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of GodBut the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faithMeekness temperance against such there is no lawAnd they that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lustsIf we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the SpiritLet us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one anotherBrethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be temptedBear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of ChristFor if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himselfBut let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in anotherFor every man shall bear his own burdenLet him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good thingsBe not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reapFor he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlastingAnd let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint notAs we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faithYe see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own handAs many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of ChristFor neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your fleshBut God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the worldFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creatureAnd as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the Israel of GodFrom henceforth let no man trouble me for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord JesusBrethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit AmenPaul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ JesusGrace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus ChristBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in ChristAccording as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in loveHaving predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his willTo the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the belovedIn whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his graceWherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudenceHaving made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himselfThat in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in himIn whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own willThat we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in ChristIn whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promiseWhich is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his gloryWherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saintsCease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayersThat the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himThe eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saintsAnd what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty powerWhich he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly placesFar above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to comeAnd hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the churchWhich is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in allAnd you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sinsWherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedienceAmong whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as othersBut God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved usEven when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are savedAnd hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ JesusThat in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ JesusFor by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of GodNot of works lest any man should boastFor we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in themWherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by handsThat at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the worldBut now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of ChristFor he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between usHaving abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peaceAnd that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity therebyAnd came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nighFor through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the FatherNow therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of GodAnd are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stoneIn whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the LordIn whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the SpiritFor this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you GentilesIf ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youwardHow that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in few wordsWhereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of ChristWhich in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the SpiritThat the Gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospelWhereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his powerUnto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of ChristAnd to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus ChristTo the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of GodAccording to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our LordIn whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of himWherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your gloryFor this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus ChristOf whom the whole family in heaven and earth is namedThat he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner manThat Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in loveMay be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and heightAnd to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of GodNow unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in usUnto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end AmenI therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are calledWith all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in loveEndeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peaceThere is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your callingOne Lord one faith one baptismOne God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you allBut unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of ChristWherefore he saith When he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto menNow that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earthHe that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all thingsAnd he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachersFor the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of ChristTill we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of ChristThat we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceiveBut speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even ChristFrom whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in loveThis I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mindHaving the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heartWho being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greedinessBut ye have not so learned ChristIf so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in JesusThat ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lustsAnd be renewed in the spirit of your mindAnd that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holinessWherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of anotherBe ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrathNeither give place to the devilLet him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needethLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearersAnd grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemptionLet all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all maliceAnd be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven youBe ye therefore followers of God as dear childrenAnd walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savourBut fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saintsNeither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanksFor this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of GodLet no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedienceBe not ye therefore partakers with themFor ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of lightFor the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truthProving what is acceptable unto the LordAnd have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove themFor it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secretBut all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is lightWherefore he saith Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee lightSee then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wiseRedeeming the time because the days are evilWherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord isAnd be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the SpiritSpeaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the LordGiving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus ChristSubmitting yourselves one to another in the fear of GodWives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the LordFor the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the bodyTherefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thingHusbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for itThat he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the wordThat he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemishSo ought men to love their wives as their own bodies He that loveth his wife loveth himselfFor no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the churchFor we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bonesFor this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one fleshThis is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the churchNevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husbandChildren obey your parents in the Lord for this is rightHonour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promiseThat it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earthAnd ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the LordServants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto ChristNot with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heartWith good will doing service as to the Lord and not to menKnowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be bond or freeAnd ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your Master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with himFinally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mightPut on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devilFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high placesWherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to standStand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousnessAnd your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peaceAbove all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wickedAnd take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of GodPraying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saintsAnd for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospelFor which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speakBut that ye also may know my affairs and how I do Tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to you all thingsWhom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your heartsPeace be to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus ChristGrace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity AmenPaul and Timotheus the servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deaconsGrace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus ChristI thank my God upon every remembrance of youAlways in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joyFor your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until nowBeing confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus ChristEven as it is meet for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my graceFor God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus ChristAnd this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgmentThat ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of ChristBeing filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of GodBut I would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospelSo that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other placesAnd many of the brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fearSome indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also of good willThe one preach Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bondsBut the other of love knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospelWhat then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I therein do rejoice yea and will rejoiceFor I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus ChristAccording to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by deathFor to me to live is Christ and to die is gainBut if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what I shall choose I wot notFor I am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far betterNevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for youAnd having this confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faithThat your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you againOnly let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospelAnd in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of GodFor unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sakeHaving the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in meIf there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and merciesFulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mindLet nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselvesLook not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of othersLet this mind be in you which was also in Christ JesusWho being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with GodBut made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of menAnd being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the crossWherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every nameThat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earthAnd that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the FatherWherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and tremblingFor it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasureDo all things without murmurings and disputingsThat ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the worldHolding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither laboured in vainYea and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith I joy and rejoice with you allFor the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with meBut I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you that I also may be of good comfort when I know your stateFor I have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your stateFor all seek their own not the things which are Jesus ChristsBut ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospelHim therefore I hope to send presently so soon as I shall see how it will go with meBut I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortlyYet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wantsFor he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sickFor indeed he was sick nigh unto death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest I should have sorrow upon sorrowI sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowfulReceive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such in reputationBecause for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward meFinally my brethren rejoice in the Lord To write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safeBeware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concisionFor we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the fleshThough I might also have confidence in the flesh If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh I moreCircumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a PhariseeConcerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blamelessBut what things were gain to me those I counted loss for ChristYea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win ChristAnd be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faithThat I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his deathIf by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the deadNot as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ JesusBrethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are beforeI press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ JesusLet us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto youNevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thingBrethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensampleFor many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of ChristWhose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly thingsFor our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour the Lord Jesus ChristWho shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himselfTherefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the Lord my dearly belovedI beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche that they be of the same mind in the LordAnd I intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of lifeRejoice in the Lord alway and again I say RejoiceLet your moderation be known unto all men The Lord is at handBe careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto GodAnd the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ JesusFinally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these thingsThose things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with youBut I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunityNot that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be contentI know both how to be abased and I know how to abound every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer needI can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth meNotwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my afflictionNow ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye onlyFor even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessityNot because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your accountBut I have all and abound I am full having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to GodBut my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ JesusNow unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever AmenSalute every saint in Christ Jesus The brethren which are with me greet youAll the saints salute you chiefly they that are of Caesars householdThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all AmenPaul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timotheus our brotherTo the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristWe give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for youSince we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saintsFor the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospelWhich is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of God in truthAs ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of ChristWho also declared unto us your love in the SpiritFor this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understandingThat ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of GodStrengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulnessGiving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in lightWho hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear SonIn whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sinsWho is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creatureFor by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for himAnd he is before all things and by him all things consistAnd he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminenceFor it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwellAnd having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heavenAnd you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciledIn the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sightIf ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof I Paul am made a ministerWho now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is the churchWhereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of GodEven the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saintsTo whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of gloryWhom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ JesusWhereunto I also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightilyFor I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at Laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the fleshThat their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of ChristIn whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledgeAnd this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing wordsFor though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in ChristAs ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in himRooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgivingBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after ChristFor in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodilyAnd ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and powerIn whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of ChristBuried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the deadAnd you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespassesBlotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his crossAnd having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in itLet no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath daysWhich are a shadow of things to come but the body is of ChristLet no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mindAnd not holding the Head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of GodWherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinancesTouch not taste not handle notWhich all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of menWhich things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying of the fleshIf ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of GodSet your affection on things above not on things on the earthFor ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in GodWhen Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in gloryMortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatryFor which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedienceIn the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in themBut now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouthLie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deedsAnd have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created himWhere there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian Scythian bond nor free but Christ is all and in allPut on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsufferingForbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do yeAnd above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectnessAnd let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankfulLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the LordAnd whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by himWives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the LordHusbands love your wives and be not bitter against themChildren obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the LordFathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouragedServants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing GodAnd whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto menKnowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord ChristBut he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of personsMasters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a Master in heavenContinue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgivingWithal praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bondsThat I may make it manifest as I ought to speakWalk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the timeLet your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every manAll my state shall Tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the LordWhom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your heartsWith Onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you They shall make known unto you all things which are done hereAristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and Marcus sisters son to Barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive himAnd Jesus which is called Justus who are of the circumcision These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God which have been a comfort unto meEpaphras who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of GodFor I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them that are in Laodicea and them in HierapolisLuke the beloved physician and Demas greet youSalute the brethren which are in Laodicea and Nymphas and the church which is in his houseAnd when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from LaodiceaAnd say to Archippus Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord that thou fulfil itThe salutation by the hand of me Paul Remember my bonds Grace be with you AmenPaul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristWe give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayersRemembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our FatherKnowing brethren beloved your election of GodFor our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sakeAnd ye became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy GhostSo that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and AchaiaFor from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thingFor they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true GodAnd to wait for his Son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to comeFor yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vainBut even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at Philippi we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contentionFor our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guileBut as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but God which trieth our heartsFor neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness God is witnessNor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of ChristBut we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her childrenSo being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of God only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto usFor ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of GodYe are witnesses and God also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believeAs ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his childrenThat ye would walk worthy of God who hath called you unto his kingdom and gloryFor this cause also thank we God without ceasing because when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believeFor ye brethren became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the JewsWho both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not God and are contrary to all menForbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermostBut we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desireWherefore we would have come unto you even I Paul once and again but Satan hindered usFor what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his comingFor ye are our glory and joyWherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at Athens aloneAnd sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faithThat no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereuntoFor verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye knowFor this cause when I could no longer forbear I sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vainBut now when Timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see youTherefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faithFor now we live if ye stand fast in the LordFor what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our GodNight and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faithNow God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto youAnd the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward youTo the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saintsFurthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and moreFor ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord JesusFor this is the will of God even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornicationThat every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honourNot in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not GodThat no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the Lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testifiedFor God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holinessHe therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God who hath also given unto us his holy SpiritBut as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one anotherAnd indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and moreAnd that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded youThat ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothingBut I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hopeFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with himFor this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleepFor the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise firstThen we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the LordWherefore comfort one another with these wordsBut of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that I write unto youFor yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the nightFor when they shall say Peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escapeBut ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thiefYe are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darknessTherefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be soberFor they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the nightBut let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvationFor God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus ChristWho died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with himWherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye doAnd we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish youAnd to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake And be at peace among yourselvesNow we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all menSee that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all menRejoice evermorePray without ceasingIn every thing give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning youQuench not the SpiritDespise not prophesyingsProve all things hold fast that which is goodAbstain from all appearance of evilAnd the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus ChristFaithful is he that calleth you who also will do itBrethren pray for usGreet all the brethren with an holy kissI charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethrenThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you AmenPaul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristGrace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristWe are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundethSo that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endureWhich is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also sufferSeeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble youAnd to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angelsIn flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus ChristWho shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his powerWhen he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that dayWherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with powerThat the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus ChristNow we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto himThat ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at handLet no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perditionWho opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is GodRemember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these thingsAnd now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his timeFor the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the wayAnd then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his comingEven him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wondersAnd with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be savedAnd for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lieThat they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousnessBut we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truthWhereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus ChristTherefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistleNow our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through graceComfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and workFinally brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with youAnd that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faithBut the Lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you from evilAnd we have confidence in the Lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command youAnd the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for ChristNow we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of usFor yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among youNeither did we eat any mans bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of youNot because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow usFor even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eatFor we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodiesNow them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own breadBut ye brethren be not weary in well doingAnd if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamedYet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brotherNow the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means The Lord be with you allThe salutation of Paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so I writeThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all AmenPaul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hopeUnto Timothy my own son in the faith Grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our LordAs I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrineNeither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so doNow the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeignedFrom which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain janglingDesiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirmBut we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfullyKnowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayersFor whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrineAccording to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trustAnd I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministryWho was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbeliefAnd the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ JesusThis is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chiefHowbeit for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlastingNow unto the King eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honour and glory for ever and ever AmenThis charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfareHolding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreckOf whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blasphemeI exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all menFor kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honestyFor this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our SaviourWho will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truthFor there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ JesusWho gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due timeWhereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verityI will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubtingIn like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly arrayBut which becometh women professing godliness with good worksLet the woman learn in silence with all subjectionBut I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silenceFor Adam was first formed then EveAnd Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgressionNotwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobrietyThis is a true saying If a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good workA bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teachNot given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetousOne that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravityFor if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of GodNot a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devilMoreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devilLikewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucreHolding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscienceAnd let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blamelessEven so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all thingsLet the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses wellFor they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ JesusThese things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortlyBut if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and ground of the truthAnd without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the Spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into gloryNow the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devilsSpeaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot ironForbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truthFor every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgivingFor it is sanctified by the word of God and prayerIf thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attainedBut refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godlinessFor bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to comeThis is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptationFor therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living God who is the Saviour of all men specially of those that believeThese things command and teachLet no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purityTill I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrineNeglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbyteryMeditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to allTake heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear theeRebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethrenThe elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purityHonour widows that are widows indeedBut if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before GodNow she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and dayBut she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she livethAnd these things give in charge that they may be blamelessBut if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidelLet not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one manWell reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good workBut the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they will marryHaving damnation because they have cast off their first faithAnd withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought notI will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfullyFor some are already turned aside after SatanIf any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeedLet the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrineFor the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn And The labourer is worthy of his rewardAgainst an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnessesThem that sin rebuke before all that others also may fearI charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partialityLay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pureDrink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmitiesSome mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow afterLikewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hidLet as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemedAnd they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit These things teach and exhortIf any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godlinessHe is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisingsPerverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyselfBut godliness with contentment is great gainFor we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing outAnd having food and raiment let us be therewith contentBut they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perditionFor the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrowsBut thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meeknessFight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnessesI give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confessionThat thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukeable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus ChristWhich in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate the King of kings and Lord of lordsWho only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting AmenCharge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoyThat they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicateLaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal lifeO Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so calledWhich some professing have erred concerning the faith Grace be with thee AmenPaul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ JesusTo Timothy my dearly beloved son Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our LordI thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and dayGreatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joyWhen I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee alsoWherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my handsFor God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mindBe not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of GodWho hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world beganBut is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospelWhereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the GentilesFor the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that dayHold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ JesusThat good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in usThis thou knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me of whom are Phygellus and HermogenesThe Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chainBut when he was in Rome he sought me out very diligently and found meThe Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus thou knowest very wellThou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ JesusAnd the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others alsoThou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus ChristNo man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldierAnd if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfullyThe husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruitsConsider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all thingsRemember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospelWherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of God is not boundTherefore I endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal gloryIt is a faithful saying For if we be dead with him we shall also live with himIf we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny usIf we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himselfOf these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearersStudy to shew thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truthBut shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodlinessAnd their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is Hymenaeus and PhiletusWho concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of someNevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal The Lord knoweth them that are his And Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquityBut in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonourIf a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and prepared unto every good workFlee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heartBut foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifesAnd the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patientIn meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truthAnd that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his willThis know also that in the last days perilous times shall comeFor men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholyWithout natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are goodTraitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of GodHaving a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn awayFor of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lustsEver learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truthNow as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faithBut they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also wasBut thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patiencePersecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered meYea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutionBut evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceivedBut continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned themAnd that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ JesusAll scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousnessThat the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good worksI charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdomPreach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrineFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching earsAnd they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fablesBut watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministryFor I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at handI have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faithHenceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearingDo thy diligence to come shortly unto meFor Demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto Thessalonica Crescens to Galatia Titus unto DalmatiaOnly Luke is with me Take Mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministryAnd Tychicus have I sent to EphesusThe cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchmentsAlexander the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord reward him according to his worksOf whom be thou ware also for he hath greatly withstood our wordsAt my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me I pray God that it may not be laid to their chargeNotwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lionAnd the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever AmenSalute Prisca and Aquila and the household of OnesiphorusErastus abode at Corinth but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sickDo thy diligence to come before winter Eubulus

Jesus Christ our SaviourFor this cause left I thee in Crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed theeIf any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unrulyFor a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucreBut a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperateHolding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayersFor there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcisionWhose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres sakeOne of themselves even a prophet of their own said The Cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow belliesThis witness is true Wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faithNot giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truthUnto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiledThey profess that they know God but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobateBut speak thou the things which become sound doctrineThat the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patienceThe aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good thingsThat they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their childrenTo be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemedYoung men likewise exhort to be sober mindedIn all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine shewing uncorruptness gravity sinceritySound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of youExhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering againNot purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all thingsFor the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all menTeaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present worldLooking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus ChristWho gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good worksThese things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority Let no man despise theePut them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good workTo speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all menFor we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one anotherBut after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appearedNot by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy GhostWhich he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our SaviourThat being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal lifeThis is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works These things are good and profitable unto menBut avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vainA man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition

fellowlabourerAnd to our beloved Apphia and Archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy houseGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristI thank my God making mention of thee always in my prayersHearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all saintsThat the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ JesusFor we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brotherWherefore though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenientYet for loves sake I rather beseech thee being such an one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus ChristI beseech thee for my son Onesimus whom I have begotten in my bondsWhich in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to meWhom I have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowelsWhom I would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospelBut without thy mind would I do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willinglyFor perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for everNot now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the LordIf thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myselfIf he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine accountI Paul have written it with mine own hand

my fellowprisoner in Christ JesusMarcus Aristarchus Demas Lucas my fellowlabourersThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit AmenGod who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophetsHath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worldsWho being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on highBeing made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than theyFor unto which of the angels said he at any time Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee And again I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a SonAnd again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith And let all the angels of God worship himAnd of the angels he saith Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fireBut unto the Son he saith Thy throne O God is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdomThou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellowsAnd Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine handsThey shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garmentAnd as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not failBut to which of the angels said he at any time Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstoolAre they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvationTherefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slipFor if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of rewardHow shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard himGod also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own willFor unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speakBut one in a certain place testified saying What is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest himThou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy handsThou hast put all things in subjection under his feet For in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him But now we see not yet all things put under himBut we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of God should taste death for every manFor it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferingsFor both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethrenSaying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto theeAnd again I will put my trust in him And again Behold I and the children which God hath given meForasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devilAnd deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondageFor verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of AbrahamWherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the peopleFor in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are temptedWherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession Christ JesusWho was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his houseFor this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the houseFor every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is GodAnd Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterBut Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the endWherefore as the Holy Ghost saith To day if ye will hear his voiceHarden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wildernessWhen your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty yearsWherefore I was grieved with that generation and said They do alway err in their heart and they have not known my waysSo I sware in my wrath They shall not enter into my restTake heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living GodBut exhort one another daily while it is called To day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sinFor we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the endWhile it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocationFor some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by MosesBut with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wildernessAnd to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed notSo we see that they could not enter in because of unbeliefLet us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of itFor unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard itFor we which have believed do enter into rest as he said As I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the worldFor he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise And God did rest the seventh day from all his worksAnd in this place again If they shall enter into my restSeeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbeliefAgain he limiteth a certain day saying in David To day after so long a time as it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heartsFor if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another dayThere remaineth therefore a rest to the people of GodFor he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from hisLet us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbeliefFor the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heartNeither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doSeeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our professionFor we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sinLet us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of needFor every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sinsWho can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmityAnd by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sinsAnd no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of God as was AaronSo also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him Thou art my Son to day have I begotten theeAs he saith also in another place Thou art a priest for ever after the order of MelchisedecWho in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he fearedThough he were a Son yet learned he obedience by the things which he sufferedAnd being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey himCalled of God an high priest after the order of MelchisedecOf whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearingFor when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meatFor every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babeBut strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evilTherefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward GodOf the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgmentAnd this will we do if God permitFor it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy GhostAnd have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to comeIf they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shameFor the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from GodBut that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burnedBut beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speakFor God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do ministerAnd we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the endThat ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promisesFor when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himselfSaying Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply theeAnd so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promiseFor men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strifeWherein God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oathThat by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before usWhich hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veilWhither the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of MelchisedecFor this Melchisedec king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed himTo whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation King of righteousness and after that also King of Salem which is King of peaceWithout father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continuallyNow consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoilsAnd verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of AbrahamBut he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promisesAnd without all contradiction the less is blessed of the betterAnd here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he livethAnd as I may so say Levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in AbrahamFor he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met himIf therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec and not be called after the order of AaronFor the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the lawFor he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altarFor it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthoodAnd it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priestWho is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless lifeFor he testifieth Thou art a priest for ever after the order of MelchisedecFor there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereofFor the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto GodAnd inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priestFor those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him The Lord sware and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of MelchisedecBy so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testamentAnd they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of deathBut this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthoodWherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for themFor such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavensWho needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himselfFor the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the Son who is consecrated for evermoreNow of the things which we have spoken this is the sum We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavensA minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not manFor every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offerFor if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the lawWho serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for See saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mountBut now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promisesFor if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the secondFor finding fault with them he saith Behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of JudahNot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my covenant and I regarded them not saith the LordFor this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a peopleAnd they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying Know the Lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatestFor I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no moreIn that he saith A new covenant he hath made the first old Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish awayThen verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuaryFor there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuaryAnd after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of allWhich had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and Aarons rod that budded and the tables of the covenantAnd over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularlyNow when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of GodBut into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the peopleThe Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standingWhich was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscienceWhich stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformationBut Christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this buildingNeither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for usFor if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the fleshHow much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living GodAnd for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritanceFor where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testatorFor a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator livethWhereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without bloodFor when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the peopleSaying This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto youMoreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministryAnd almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remissionIt was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than theseFor Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for usNor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of othersFor then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himselfAnd as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgmentSo Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvationFor the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfectFor then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sinsBut in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every yearFor it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sinsWherefore when he cometh into the world he saith Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared meIn burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasureThen said I Lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O GodAbove when he said Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the lawThen said he Lo I come to do thy will O God He taketh away the first that he may establish the secondBy the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for allAnd every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sinsBut this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of GodFrom henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstoolFor by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctifiedWhereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said beforeThis is the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write themAnd their sins and iniquities will I remember no moreNow where remission of these is there is no more offering for sinHaving therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of JesusBy a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his fleshAnd having an high priest over the house of GodLet us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure waterLet us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promisedAnd let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good worksNot forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approachingFor if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinsBut a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversariesHe that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnessesOf how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the Spirit of graceFor we know him that hath said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense saith the Lord And again The Lord shall judge his peopleIt is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GodBut call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictionsPartly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so usedFor ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substanceCast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of rewardFor ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promiseFor yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarryNow the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in himBut we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soulNow faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seenFor by it the elders obtained a good reportThrough faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appearBy faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speakethBy faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased GodBut without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek himBy faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faithBy faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he wentBy faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promiseFor he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is GodThrough faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promisedTherefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerableThese all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earthFor they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a countryAnd truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returnedBut now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a cityBy faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten sonOf whom it was said That in Isaac shall thy seed be calledAccounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figureBy faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to comeBy faith Jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staffBy faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bonesBy faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandmentBy faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughterChoosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a seasonEsteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the rewardBy faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisibleThrough faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch themBy faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land which the Egyptians assaying to do were drownedBy faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven daysBy faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peaceAnd what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon and of Barak and of Samson and of Jephthae of David also and Samuel and of the prophetsWho through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lionsQuenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliensWomen received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrectionAnd others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonmentThey were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormentedOf whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earthAnd these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promiseGod having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfectWherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before usLooking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of GodFor consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your mindsYe have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sinAnd ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children My son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of himFor whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receivethIf ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth notBut if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sonsFurthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and liveFor they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holinessNow no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised therebyWherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble kneesAnd make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healedFollow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the LordLooking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiledLest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthrightFor ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tearsFor ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempestAnd the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any moreFor they could not endure that which was commanded And if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dartAnd so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quakeBut ye are come unto mount Sion and unto the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angelsTo the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfectAnd to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of AbelSee that ye refuse not him that speaketh For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heavenWhose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heavenAnd this word Yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remainWherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fearFor our God is a consuming fireLet brotherly love continueBe not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawaresRemember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the bodyMarriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judgeLet your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake theeSo that we may boldly say The Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto meRemember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversationJesus Christ the same yesterday and to day and for everBe not carried about with divers and strange doctrines For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied thereinWe have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacleFor the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the campWherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gateLet us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproachFor here have we no continuing city but we seek one to comeBy him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his nameBut to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleasedObey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for youPray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestlyBut I beseech you the rather to do this that I may be restored to you the soonerNow the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenantMake you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever AmenAnd I beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for I have written a letter unto you in few wordsKnow ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly I will see youSalute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints They of Italy salute youGrace be with you all AmenJames a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greetingMy brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptationsKnowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patienceBut let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothingIf any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given himBut let him ask in faith nothing wavering For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossedFor let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the LordA double minded man is unstable in all his waysLet the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exaltedBut the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass awayFor the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his waysBlessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord hath promised to them that love himLet no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any manBut every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticedThen when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth deathDo not err my beloved brethrenEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turningOf his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creaturesWherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrathFor the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of GodWherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soulsBut be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selvesFor if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glassFor he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he wasBut whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deedIf any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vainPure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the worldMy brethren have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respect of personsFor if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raimentAnd ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him Sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor Stand thou there or sit here under my footstoolAre ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughtsHearken my beloved brethren Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love himBut ye have despised the poor Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seatsDo not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are calledIf ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do wellBut if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressorsFor whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of allFor he that said Do not commit adultery said also Do not kill Now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the lawSo speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of libertyFor he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgmentWhat doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save himIf a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily foodAnd one of you say unto them Depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profitEven so faith if it hath not works is dead being aloneYea a man may say Thou hast faith and I have works shew me thy faith without thy works and I will shew thee my faith by my worksThou believest that there is one God thou doest well the devils also believe and trembleBut wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is deadWas not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altarSeest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfectAnd the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the Friend of GodYe see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith onlyLikewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another wayFor as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead alsoMy brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnationFor in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole bodyBehold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole bodyBehold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listethEven so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things Behold how great a matter a little fire kindlethAnd the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hellFor every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankindBut the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poisonTherewith bless we God even the Father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of GodOut of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing My brethren these things ought not so to beDoth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitterCan the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and freshWho is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdomBut if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truthThis wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilishFor where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil workBut the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisyAnd the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peaceFrom whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your membersYe lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask notYe ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lustsYe adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of GodDo ye think that the scripture saith in vain The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envyBut he giveth more grace Wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humbleSubmit yourselves therefore to God Resist the devil and he will flee from youDraw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you Cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double mindedBe afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heavinessHumble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you upSpeak not evil one of another brethren He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judgeThere is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest anotherGo to now ye that say To day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gainWhereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow For what is your life It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth awayFor that ye ought to say If the Lord will we shall live and do this or thatBut now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evilTherefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sinGo to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon youYour riches are corrupted and your garments are motheatenYour gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire Ye have heaped treasure together for the last daysBehold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaothYe have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughterYe have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist youBe patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rainBe ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nighGrudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the doorTake my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patienceBehold we count them happy which endure Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercyBut above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnationIs any among you afflicted let him pray Is any merry let him sing psalmsIs any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the LordAnd the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven himConfess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth muchElias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six monthsAnd he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruitBrethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert himLet him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sinsPeter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and BithyniaElect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multipliedBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the deadTo an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for youWho are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last timeWherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptationsThat the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus ChristWhom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of gloryReceiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soulsOf which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto youSearching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should followUnto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look intoWherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus ChristAs obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignoranceBut as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversationBecause it is written Be ye holy for I am holyAnd if ye call on the Father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your sojourning here in fearForasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathersBut with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spotWho verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for youWho by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in GodSeeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart ferventlyBeing born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth for everFor all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass The grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth awayBut the word of the Lord endureth for ever And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto youWherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakingsAs newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow therebyIf so be ye have tasted that the Lord is graciousTo whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and preciousYe also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus ChristWherefore also it is contained in the scripture Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confoundedUnto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the cornerAnd a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointedBut ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous lightWhich in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercyDearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soulHaving your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitationSubmit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake whether it be to the king as supremeOr unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do wellFor so is the will of God that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish menAs free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of GodHonour all men Love the brotherhood Fear God Honour the kingServants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the frowardFor this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfullyFor what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with GodFor even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his stepsWho did no sin neither was guile found in his mouthWho when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteouslyWho his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healedFor ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your soulsLikewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wivesWhile they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fearWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparelBut let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great priceFor after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbandsEven as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazementLikewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hinderedFinally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteousNot rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessingFor he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guileLet him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue itFor the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evilAnd who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is goodBut and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubledBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fearHaving a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in ChristFor it is better if the will of God be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doingFor Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the SpiritBy which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prisonWhich sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by waterThe like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus ChristWho is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto himForasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sinThat he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of GodFor the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatriesWherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of youWho shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the deadFor for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spiritBut the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayerAnd above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sinsUse hospitality one to another without grudgingAs every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of GodIf any man speak let him speak as the oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever AmenBeloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto youBut rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joyIf ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorifiedBut let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens mattersYet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalfFor the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of GodAnd if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appearWherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful CreatorThe elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealedFeed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mindNeither as being lords over Gods heritage but being ensamples to the flockAnd when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not awayLikewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder Yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humbleHumble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due timeCasting all your care upon him for he careth for youBe sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devourWhom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the worldBut the God of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle youTo him be glory and dominion for ever and ever AmenBy Silvanus a faithful brother unto you as I suppose I have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye standThe church that is at Babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth Marcus my sonGreet ye one another with a kiss of charity Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus AmenSimon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus ChristGrace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our LordAccording as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtueWhereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lustAnd beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledgeAnd to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godlinessAnd to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charityFor if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus ChristBut he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sinsWherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fallFor so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus ChristWherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truthYea I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembranceKnowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed meMoreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembranceFor we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majestyFor he received from God the Father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleasedAnd this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountWe have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heartsKnowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretationFor the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy GhostBut there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destructionAnd many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken ofAnd through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth notFor if God spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgmentAnd spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodlyAnd turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodlyAnd delivered just Lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wickedFor that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deedsThe Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punishedBut chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government Presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitiesWhereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the LordBut these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruptionAnd shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time Spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with youHaving eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed childrenWhich have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousnessBut was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophetThese are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for everFor when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in errorWhile they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondageFor if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginningFor it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto themBut it is happened unto them according to the true proverb The dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mireThis second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembranceThat ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and SaviourKnowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lustsAnd saying Where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creationFor this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the waterWhereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perishedBut the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly menBut beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one dayThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentanceBut the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned upSeeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godlinessLooking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heatNevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousnessWherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blamelessAnd account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto youAs also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destructionYe therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastnessBut grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ To him be glory both now and for ever AmenThat which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the Word of lifeFor the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto usThat which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus ChristAnd these things write we unto you that your joy may be fullThis then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at allIf we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truthBut if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sinIf we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in usIf we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousnessIf we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in usMy little children these things write I unto you that ye sin not And if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteousAnd he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole worldAnd hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandmentsHe that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in himBut whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in himHe that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walkedBrethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginningAgain a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shinethHe that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until nowHe that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in himBut he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyesI write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sakeI write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because ye have known the FatherI have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked oneLove not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in himFor all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the worldAnd the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for everLittle children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last timeThey went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of usBut ye have an unction from the Holy One and ye know all thingsI have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truthWho is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ He is antichrist that denieth the Father and the SonWhosoever denieth the Son the same hath not the Father but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father alsoLet that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the Son and in the FatherAnd this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal lifeThese things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce youBut the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in himAnd now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his comingIf ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of himBehold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him notBeloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he isAnd every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pureWhosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the lawAnd ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sinWhosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known himLittle children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteousHe that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devilWhosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of GodIn this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brotherFor this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one anotherNot as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother And wherefore slew he him Because his own works were evil and his brothers righteousMarvel not my brethren if the world hate youWe know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren He that loveth not his brother abideth in deathWhosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himHereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethrenBut whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in himMy little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truthAnd hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before himFor if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all thingsBeloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward GodAnd whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sightAnd this is his commandment That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandmentAnd he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him And hereby we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given usBeloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the worldHereby know ye the Spirit of God Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of GodAnd every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the worldYe are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the worldThey are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth themWe are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us Hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of errorBeloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth GodHe that loveth not knoweth not God for God is loveIn this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through himHerein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sinsBeloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one anotherNo man hath seen God at any time If we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in usHereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his SpiritAnd we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the worldWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God God dwelleth in him and he in GodAnd we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in himHerein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this worldThere is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment He that feareth is not made perfect in loveWe love him because he first loved usIf a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seenAnd this commandment have we from him That he who loveth God love his brother alsoWhosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of himBy this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandmentsFor this is the love of God that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievousFor whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faithWho is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of GodThis is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood And it is the Spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truthFor there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy Ghost and these three are oneAnd there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in oneIf we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his SonHe that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his SonAnd this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his SonHe that hath the Son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not lifeThese things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of GodAnd this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth usAnd if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of himIf any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death There is a sin unto death I do not say that he shall pray for itAll unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto deathWe know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him notAnd we know that we are of God and the whole world lieth in wickednessAnd we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his Son Jesus Christ This is the true God and eternal lifeLittle children keep yourselves from idols AmenThe elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truthFor the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for everGrace be with you mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and loveI rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the FatherAnd now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one anotherAnd this is love that we walk after his commandments This is the commandment That as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in itFor many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh This is a deceiver and an antichristLook to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full rewardWhosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the Father and the SonIf there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him God speedFor he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deedsHaving many things to write unto you I would not write with paper and ink but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be fullThe children of thy elect sister greet thee AmenThe elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius whom I love in the truthBeloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosperethFor I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truthI have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truthBeloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangersWhich have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do wellBecause that for his names sake they went forth taking nothing of the GentilesWe therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truthI wrote unto the church but Diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us notWherefore if I come I will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the churchBeloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good He that doeth good is of God but he that doeth evil hath not seen GodDemetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is trueI had many things to write but I will not with ink and pen write unto theeBut I trust I shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face Peace be to thee Our friends salute thee Greet the friends by nameJude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and calledMercy unto you and peace and love be multipliedBeloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saintsFor there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus ChristI will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed notAnd the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great dayEven as Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fireLikewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignitiesYet Michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said The Lord rebuke theeBut these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselvesWoe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of CoreThese are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the rootsRaging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for everAnd Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saintsTo execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against himThese are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having mens persons in admiration because of advantageBut beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus ChristHow that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lustsThese be they who separate themselves sensual having not the SpiritBut ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy GhostKeep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal lifeAnd of some have compassion making a differenceAnd others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the fleshNow unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joyTo the only wise God our Saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever AmenThe Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant JohnWho bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he sawBlessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at handJohn to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven Spirits which are before his throneAnd from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own bloodAnd hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever AmenBehold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him Even so AmenI am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the AlmightyI John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus ChristI was in the Spirit on the Lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpetSaying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and What thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto Smyrna and unto Pergamos and unto Thyatira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto LaodiceaAnd I turned to see the voice that spake with me And being turned I saw seven golden candlesticksAnd in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdleHis head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fireAnd his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many watersAnd he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strengthAnd when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead And he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me Fear not I am the first and the lastI am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive for evermore Amen and have the keys of hell and of deathWrite the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafterThe mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churchesUnto the angel of the church of Ephesus write These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticksI know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liarsAnd hast borne and hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not faintedNevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first loveRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repentBut this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hateHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of GodAnd unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write These things saith the first and the last which was dead and is aliveI know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of SatanFear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of lifeHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second deathAnd to the angel of the church in Pergamos write These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edgesI know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satans seat is and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwellethBut I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornicationSo hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hateRepent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouthHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth itAnd unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write These things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brassI know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the firstNotwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idolsAnd I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented notBehold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deedsAnd I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your worksBut unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burdenBut that which ye have already hold fast till I comeAnd he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nationsAnd he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I received of my FatherAnd I will give him the morning starHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churchesAnd unto the angel of the church in Sardis write These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art deadBe watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before GodRemember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent If therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon theeThou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthyHe that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angelsHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churchesAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write These things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openethI know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my nameBehold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved theeBecause thou hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earthBehold I come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crownHim that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is new Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new nameHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churchesAnd unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write These things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of GodI know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hotSo then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spue thee out of my mouthBecause thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and nakedI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest seeAs many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repentBehold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with meTo him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in his throneHe that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churchesAfter this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said Come up hither and I will shew thee things which must be hereafterAnd immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throneAnd he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emeraldAnd round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of goldAnd out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven Spirits of GodAnd before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behindAnd the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagleAnd the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying Holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to comeAnd when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and everThe four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne sayingThou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were createdAnd I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven sealsAnd I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereofAnd no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereonAnd I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereonAnd one of the elders saith unto me Weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Juda the Root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereofAnd I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a Lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earthAnd he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throneAnd when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saintsAnd they sung a new song saying Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nationAnd hast made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earthAnd I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousandsSaying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessingAnd every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying Blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ever and everAnd the four beasts said Amen And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and everAnd I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying Come and seeAnd I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquerAnd when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say Come and seeAnd there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great swordAnd when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say Come and see And I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his handAnd I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say A measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wineAnd when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say Come and seeAnd I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earthAnd when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they heldAnd they cried with a loud voice saying How long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earthAnd white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilledAnd I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as bloodAnd the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty windAnd the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their placesAnd the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountainsAnd said to the mountains and rocks Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the LambFor the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to standAnd after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any treeAnd I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the seaSaying Hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheadsAnd I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of IsraelOf the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousandOf the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousandOf the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousandOf the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousandAfter this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the Lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their handsAnd cried with a loud voice saying Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the LambAnd all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped GodSaying Amen Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our God for ever and ever AmenAnd one of the elders answered saying unto me What are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came theyAnd I said unto him Sir thou knowest And he said to me These are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the LambTherefore are they before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among themThey shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heatFor the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyesAnd when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hourAnd I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpetsAnd another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throneAnd the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before God out of the angels handAnd the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquakeAnd the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to soundThe first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt upAnd the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became bloodAnd the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyedAnd the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of watersAnd the name of the star is called Wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitterAnd the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewiseAnd I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice Woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to soundAnd the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pitAnd he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pitAnd there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have powerAnd it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheadsAnd to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a manAnd in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from themAnd the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of menAnd they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lionsAnd they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battleAnd they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five monthsAnd they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the Greek tongue hath his name ApollyonOne woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafterAnd the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before GodSaying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river EuphratesAnd the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of menAnd the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard the number of themAnd thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstoneBy these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouthsFor their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurtAnd the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walkNeither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their theftsAnd I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fireAnd he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earthAnd cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voicesAnd when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them notAnd the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heavenAnd sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longerBut in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophetsAnd the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earthAnd I went unto the angel and said unto him Give me the little book And he said unto me Take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honeyAnd I took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitterAnd he said unto me Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kingsAnd there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship thereinBut the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two monthsAnd I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackclothThese are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earthAnd if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killedThese have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they willAnd when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill themAnd their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucifiedAnd they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in gravesAnd they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earthAnd after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw themAnd they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them Come up hither And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld themAnd the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the God of heavenThe second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quicklyAnd the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and everAnd the four and twenty elders which sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped GodSaying We give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reignedAnd the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earthAnd the temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hailAnd there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve starsAnd she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be deliveredAnd there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his headsAnd his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was bornAnd she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throneAnd the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore daysAnd there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angelsAnd prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heavenAnd the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the Devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with himAnd I heard a loud voice saying in heaven Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and nightAnd they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the deathTherefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short timeAnd when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man childAnd to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpentAnd the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the floodAnd the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouthAnd the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus ChristAnd I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemyAnd the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authorityAnd I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beastAnd they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying Who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with himAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two monthsAnd he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heavenAnd it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nationsAnd all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the worldIf any man have an ear let him hearHe that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword Here is the patience and the faith of the saintsAnd I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragonAnd he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healedAnd he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of menAnd deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did liveAnd he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killedAnd he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheadsAnd that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his nameHere is wisdom Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is Six hundred threescore and sixAnd I looked and lo a Lamb stood on the mount Sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his Fathers name written in their foreheadsAnd I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harpsAnd they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earthThese are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth These were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto God and to the LambAnd in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of GodAnd I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and peopleSaying with a loud voice Fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of watersAnd there followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornicationAnd the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his handThe same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the LambAnd the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his nameHere is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of JesusAnd I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me Write Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow themAnd I looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickleAnd another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud Thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripeAnd he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reapedAnd another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickleAnd another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripeAnd the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of GodAnd the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongsAnd I saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of GodAnd I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of GodAnd they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb saying Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou King of saintsWho shall not fear thee O Lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifestAnd after that I looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was openedAnd the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdlesAnd one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God who liveth for ever and everAnd the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilledAnd I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels Go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earthAnd the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his imageAnd the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the seaAnd the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became bloodAnd I heard the angel of the waters say Thou art righteous O Lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thusFor they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthyAnd I heard another out of the altar say Even so Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgmentsAnd the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fireAnd men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of God which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him gloryAnd the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for painAnd blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deedsAnd the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be preparedAnd I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophetFor they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God AlmightyBehold I come as a thief Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shameAnd he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue ArmageddonAnd the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying It is doneAnd there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so greatAnd the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great Babylon came in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrathAnd every island fled away and the mountains were not foundAnd there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding greatAnd there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me Come hither I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many watersWith whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornicationSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten hornsAnd the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornicationAnd upon her forehead was a name written MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTHAnd I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admirationAnd the angel said unto me Wherefore didst thou marvel I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten hornsThe beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet isAnd here is the mind which hath wisdom The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sittethAnd there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short spaceAnd the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perditionAnd the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beastThese have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beastThese shall make war with the Lamb and the Lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithfulAnd he saith unto me The waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tonguesAnd the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fireFor God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilledAnd the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earthAnd after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his gloryAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birdFor all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicaciesAnd I heard another voice from heaven saying Come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plaguesFor her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquitiesReward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her doubleHow much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrowTherefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judgeth herAnd the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burningStanding afar off for the fear of her torment saying Alas alas that great city Babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment comeAnd the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any moreThe merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marbleAnd cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of menAnd the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at allThe merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailingAnd saying Alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearlsFor in one hour so great riches is come to nought And every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar offAnd cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying What city is like unto this great cityAnd they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying Alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolateRejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for God hath avenged you on herAnd a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at allAnd the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in theeAnd the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceivedAnd in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earthAnd after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia Salvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our GodFor true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her handAnd again they said Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and everAnd the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne saying Amen AlleluiaAnd a voice came out of the throne saying Praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and greatAnd I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reignethLet us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself readyAnd to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saintsAnd he saith unto me Write Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb And he saith unto me These are the true sayings of GodAnd I fell at his feet to worship him And he said unto me See thou do it not I am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecyAnd I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True and in righteousness he doth judge and make warHis eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himselfAnd he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called The Word of GodAnd the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and cleanAnd out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty GodAnd he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDSAnd I saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great GodThat ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and greatAnd I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his armyAnd the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstoneAnd the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their fleshAnd I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his handAnd he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the Devil and Satan and bound him a thousand yearsAnd cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little seasonAnd I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand yearsBut the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished This is the first resurrectionBlessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand yearsAnd when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prisonAnd shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the seaAnd they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured themAnd the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and everAnd I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for themAnd I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their worksAnd the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their worksAnd death and hell were cast into the lake of fire This is the second deathAnd whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fireAnd I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more seaAnd I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husbandAnd I heard a great voice out of heaven saying Behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their GodAnd God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed awayAnd he that sat upon the throne said Behold I make all things new And he said unto me Write for these words are true and faithfulAnd he said unto me It is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freelyHe that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my sonBut the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second deathAnd there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying Come hither I will shew thee the bride the Lambs wifeAnd he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from GodHaving the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystalAnd had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of IsraelOn the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gatesAnd the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the LambAnd he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereofAnd the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs The length and the breadth and the height of it are equalAnd he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angelAnd the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glassAnd the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones The first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emeraldThe fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethystAnd the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glassAnd I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of itAnd the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is the light thereofAnd the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into itAnd the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night thereAnd they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into itAnd there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lambs book of lifeAnd he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the LambIn the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nationsAnd there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve himAnd they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheadsAnd there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and everAnd he said unto me These sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be doneBehold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this bookAnd I John saw these things and heard them And when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these thingsThen saith he unto me See thou do it not for I am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship GodAnd he saith unto me Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at handHe that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy stillAnd behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall beI am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the lastBlessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the cityFor without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lieI Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning starAnd the Spirit and the bride say Come And let him that heareth say Come And let him that is athirst come And whosoever will let him take the water of life freelyFor I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this bookAnd if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this bookHe which testifieth these things saith Surely I come quickly Amen Even so come Lord JesusThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen
