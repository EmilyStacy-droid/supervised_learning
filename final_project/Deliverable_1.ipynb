    "        Precision, recall, and F1-score for the class of \"Marked Words\" were computed to provide detailed performance metrics. These metrics give insights into the model's ability to correctly identify relevant words. However, as we mentioned before, being able to recognize all marked words does not promise that the extracted words will meet the potential users' needs, and we will need to think of extracting more meaningful phrases rather than a single word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ROC Curve and AUC:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The ROC curve and AUC score were computed to assess the modelâ€™s discriminative ability. A 45-degree diagonal ROC curve would suggest a model with no discriminative power, but adjustments were made to ensure the ROC curve correctly reflected the model's performance.\n",
    "Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "    Confusion Matrix Plot:\n",
    "        The confusion matrix was visualized to illustrate the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The plot highlighted the distribution of predictions across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    TF-IDF Heatmap:\n",
    "        A heatmap was generated to visualize the TF-IDF values across different segments and tokens. Non-zero tokens were selected for better clarity, revealing how the model weights different features.\n",
    "Iteration and Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "    Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "        The model underwent multiple iterations of training and evaluation. Initial observations of perfect accuracy led to additional validation steps, including cross-validation and ROC curve analysis, to ensure robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Selection:\n",
    "        The feature selection process involved using TF-IDF to identify important tokens. Only non-zero tokens were considered for visualization to focus on relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model Comparison:\n",
    "        Although only the SVM model was used, comparisons were made against baseline metrics and theoretical expectations. The performance was analyzed in the context of potential overfitting and model generalization.\n",
    "Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model Performance:\n",
    "        The high accuracy observed may indicate overfitting or an overly simplistic test set. Additional metrics and validations were used to ensure the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Challenges:\n",
    "        Challenges included ensuring the representativeness of the test set and addressing class imbalance. Future work will involve testing different models on new data and extracting meaningful phrases"
